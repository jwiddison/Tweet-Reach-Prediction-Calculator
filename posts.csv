chdsandeep,9/8/2016 17:02,"Millard Fillmore (January 7, 1800 – March 8, 1874) was an American statesman who served as the 13th President of the United States from 1850 to 1853. He was the last Whig president, and the last president not to be affiliated with either the Democratic or Republican parties. Fillmore was the only Whig president who did not die in office or get expelled from the party, and Fillmore appointed the only Whig Supreme Court Justice. As Zachary Taylor's vice president, he assumed the presidency after Taylor's death.
Fillmore was a lawyer from western New York state, and an early member of the Whig Party. He served in the state legislature (1829–1831), as a U.S. Representative (1833–35, 1837–43), and as New York State Comptroller (1848–49). He was elected vice president of the United States in 1848 as Taylor's running mate, and served from 1849 until Taylor's death in 1850, at the height of the ""Crisis of 1850"" over slavery.
As an anti-slavery moderate, he opposed abolitionist demands to exclude slavery from all the territory gained in the Mexican War. Instead he supported the Compromise of 1850, which briefly ended the crisis. In foreign policy, Fillmore supported U.S. Navy expeditions to open trade in Japan, opposed French designs on Hawaii, and was embarrassed by Narciso López's filibuster expeditions to Cuba. He sought election to a full term in 1852, but was passed over for the nomination by the Whigs. When the Whig Party broke up in 1854–56, Fillmore refused to join the Republican Party. Unlike many other conservative Whigs, Fillmore did not join the American Party, the political arm of the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic ""Know-Nothing"" movement. While out of the country, he was nevertheless nominated by the American Party as their candidate for President in 1856.
He finished third in the election, surpassed by the Republican Party candidate. During the American Civil War, Fillmore denounced secession and agreed that the Union must be maintained by force if necessary, but was very critical of the war policies of President Abraham Lincoln. After the war, he supported the Reconstructionpolicies of President Andrew Johnson. Although some have praised Fillmore's restrained foreign policy, he is criticized for having further aggravated tensions between abolitionists and slaveholders. He is placed near the bottom 10 of historical rankings of Presidents of the United States by various scholarly surveys.
Fillmore founded the University at Buffalo and was the university's first chancellor. He also helped found theBuffalo Historical Society and the Buffalo General Hospital.
Early life and career
Millard Fillmore was born in a log cabin in Moravia, Cayuga County, in the Finger Lakes region of New York State, on January 7, 1800. His parents were Phoebe (Millard) and Nathaniel Fillmore. He was the second of nine children and the eldest son. He later lived in East Aurora, New York in the southtowns region south ofBuffalo. Fillmore became a Unitarian in later life. His father apprenticed him to cloth maker Benjamin Hungerford in Sparta, New York, at age fourteen to learn the cloth-making trade. He left after four months, but subsequently took another apprenticeship in the same trade at New Hope, New York. He struggled to obtain an education living on the frontier and attended New Hope Academy for six months in 1819. There he fell in love with his future wife Abigail Powers.
Later that year, Fillmore bought out his cloth-making apprenticeship, and began to study law under Judge Walter Wood of Montville. Upon deciding that Judge Wood was not providing him the training he required, Fillmore bought out his agreement with Wood and moved to Buffalo, where he continued his studies in the law office of Asa Rice and Joseph Clary. He was admitted to the bar in 1823 and began his law practice in East Aurora, New York. In 1825, he built a house there for himself and Abigail. They were married on February 5, 1826. They had two children, Millard Powers Fillmore and Mary Abigail Fillmore.
In 1834, he formed a law partnership, Fillmore and Hall (which became Fillmore, Hall and Haven in 1836), with close friend Nathan K. Hall who would later serve in his cabinet as Postmaster General. It would become one of western New York's most prestigious firms, and exists to this day as Hodgson Russ LLP.
Fillmore was a member of the New York Militia in the 1820s and 1830s, and served as Inspector of New York's 47th Brigade with the rank of Major.
In 1846, he helped found the private University of Buffalo, which today is the public State University of New York at Buffalo, the largest school in the State University of New York system.
Politics
In 1828, Fillmore was elected to the New York State Assembly on the Anti-Masonic ticket, serving three one-year terms, from 1829 to 1831. In his final term he chaired a special legislative committee to enact a new bankruptcy law that eliminated debtors' prison. As the measure had support among some Democrats, he maneuvered the law into place by taking a nonpartisan approach and allowing the Democrats to take credit for the bill. This kind of inconspicuousness and avoiding the limelight would later characterize Fillmore's approach to politics on the national stage.
He was a follower and associate of Thurlow Weed, who had been a leading Anti-Mason. When Weed left the Anti-Masons in 1832, Fillmore did too; when Weed became the leading Whig organizer in New York, Fillmore also joined the Whigs. In 1832, he was elected U.S. Representative from New York's 32nd congressional districta ""National Republican"", serving in the 23rd Congress from 1833 to 1835. He was succeeded in 1834 by ""Anti-Jacksonian"" Thomas C. Love. Love declined renomination in 1836, and Fillmore was elected as a Whig (having followed his mentor Thurlow Weed into the party). He was re-elected twice, serving from 1837 to 1843, in the25th, 26th, and 27th Congresses. He declined re-nomination in 1842.
In Congress, he opposed admitting Texas as a slave territory, he advocated internal improvements and aprotective tariff, he supported John Quincy Adams by voting to receive anti-slavery petitions, he advocated the prohibition by Congress of the slave trade between the states, and he favored the exclusion of slavery from theDistrict of Columbia. He came in second place in the vote for Speaker of the House in 1841. He served as chair of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1841 to 1843 and was an author of the Tariff of 1842, as well as two other bills that President John Tyler vetoed.
Fillmore was a candidate for vice president at the 1844 Whig National Convention, but lost the nomination toTheodore Frelinghuysen. Later that year, Fillmore was the unsuccessful Whig Party candidate for Governor of New York. In 1847 he won election as the first New York State Comptroller chosen by popular vote, defeatingOrville Hungerford 174,756 to 136,027. He held the office from 1848 to 1849, and received credit for revising New York's banking system and making it a model for the future National Banking System.
Vice presidency (1849–1850)
The 1848 Whig National Convention nominated General Zachary Taylor, a slaveholder from Virginia, for President. This upset supporters of Henry Clayand ""Conscience Whigs"" opposed to slavery in territories gained in the Mexican–American War. A group of Whig pragmatists sought to balance the ticket, and the convention nominated Fillmore for Vice President. Fillmore came from a free state, had moderate anti-slavery views, and could help carry the populous state of New York.
Fillmore was also selected in part to prevent the nomination of the anti-slavery William H. Seward, and prevent Seward from receiving a position in Taylor's cabinet. (In an era where the President, Vice President and cabinet were expected to reflect geographic balance, Fillmore would ""represent"" New York, meaning another New Yorker – Seward – could not be in the cabinet.)
The Taylor-Fillmore ticket won, taking 1,361,393 votes (47.3%) and 163 electoral votes (16 states carried). Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler, the Democrats, took 1,223,460 votes (42.5%) and 127 electoral votes (15 states carried). The third-party Free Soil candidatesMartin Van Buren and Charles Francis Adams, Sr. took only 291,501 votes (10.1%) and 0 electoral votes.
Soon the nation was roiled by the ""Crisis of 1850"". Pro-slavery Southerners demanded that all the new territories should be open to slavery. Anti-slavery Northerners demanded complete exclusion. The recently admitted state of Texas claimed a large part of New Mexico, and wanted the U.S. to assume the ""national debt"" of the former Republic of Texas. California settlers were petitioning for immediate admission as a free state, with no territorial stage. There were also disputes about slavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia, about the apprehension of slaves who escaped to the free states, and about the territorial status of Utah, newly settled by the Mormons.
Fillmore presided over the Senate during the months of nerve-wracking debates over these issues. During one debate, enraged Senator Thomas Hart Bentonof Missouri stalked toward Senator Henry S. Foote of Mississippi, who brandished a pistol at Benton.
Taylor stunned his fellow Southerners by urging the immediate admission of California and New Mexico as free states. Ironically, it was Fillmore, the Northerner, who supported slavery in at least part of the territory to avoid an open break with the South. He wrote: ""God knows that I detest slavery, but it is an existing evil ... and we must endure it and give it such protection as is guaranteed by the Constitution.""
Clay constructed a compromise bill which included provisions desired by both sides. Fillmore did not comment publicly on the merits of the compromise proposals. A few days before President Taylor's death, Fillmore suggested to the President that if the vote on Clay's bill was tied, he as President of the Senate would cast his tie-breaking vote in favor.

Domestic affairs
Taylor died suddenly on July 9, 1850, and Fillmore became President. The change in leadership also signaled an abrupt political shift. Taylor, it was thought, would have vetoed the Compromise bill (though some historians now doubt this). When Fillmore took office, the entire cabinet offered their resignations. Fillmore accepted them all and appointed men who, except for Treasury Secretary Thomas Corwin, favored the Compromise of 1850. When the compromise finally came before both Houses of Congress, it was very watered down. As a result, Fillmore urged Congress to pass the original bill. This move only provoked an enormous battle where ""forces for and against slavery fought over every word of the bill."" To Fillmore's disappointment the bitter battle over the bill crushed public support. Clay, exhausted, left Washington to recuperate, passing leadership to Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois. At this critical juncture, President Fillmore announced his support of the Compromise of 1850.
On August 6, 1850, he sent a message to Congress recommending that Texas's debts be paid provided Texas abandoned its claims in New Mexico. This, and his deployment of 750 Federal troops to New Mexico, helped shift a critical number of northern Whigs in Congress away from their insistence upon the Wilmot Proviso, the stipulation that all the Mexican lands must be closed to slavery. Douglas modified Clay's bill accordingly, and then split it into five separate Senate bills. These bills were: admission of California as a free state (which happened on September 9, 1850); settlement of the Texas boundary and debts; creation of New Mexico Territory, which would be open to slavery; the Fugitive Slave Act; and abolition of the slave trade (but not slavery), in the District of Columbia.
Each measure obtained a majority, and, by September 20, President Fillmore had signed them into law. Daniel Websterwrote, ""I can now sleep of nights."" Only a few extremists on both sides denounced the Compromise. A slave-state convention called to discuss secession drew only a few delegates. Northerners were happy with the admission of California. Nonetheless, the Compromise disrupted the Whig party, which did badly in the fall 1850 elections in the north. Northern Whigs were heard to say ""God save us from Whig Vice Presidents.""
Fillmore's greatest difficulty was the Fugitive Slave Law: southerners complained bitterly about any slackness, but enforcement was highly offensive to northerners. Fillmore's solution was to enforce the Fugitive Slave Law, but also enforce the Neutrality Act of 1818 against filibustering Southerners who were trying to make Cuba a slave state.
Fillmore appointed Brigham Young as the first governor of the Utah Territory in 1850. In gratitude for creating the Utah Territory in 1850 and appointing Young as governor, Young named the territorial capital ""Fillmore"" and the surrounding county ""Millard"".
Fillmore appointed Benjamin Robbins Curtis to seat two of the Supreme Court of the United States. Curtis served from September 22, 1851, to September 30, 1857.
He attempted four times to fill the vacancy caused by Justice John McKinley's death. The Senate took no action on the nomination of New Orleans attorneyEdward A. Bradford. George Edmund Badger withdrew his nomination. Senator Judah P. Benjamin declined to serve. The nomination of William C. Micou, another New Orleans lawyer recommended by Benjamin, was not acted on by the Senate. The vacancy was finally filled after Fillmore's term, when President Pierce nominated John Archibald Campbell, who was confirmed by the Senate.
Fillmore also appointed four other federal judges, all to United States district courts. John Glenn was appointed to the United States District Court for the District of Maryland and served from March 19, 1852 to July 8, 1853.
Nathan K. Hall was appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York and served from August 31, 1852 to March 3, 1874.
Ogden Hoffman, Jr. was appointed to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. He began serving on February 27, 1851. Hoffman was reassigned several times, beginning on January 18, 1854, as the California federal courts were redistricted. He served until July 23, 1866.
James McHall Jones was appointed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California and served from December 26, 1850 to December 15, 1851.
Foreign affairs
In foreign affairs, Fillmore was particularly active in the Asia and the Pacific, especially with regard to Japan, which at this time still prohibited nearly all foreign contact. American merchants and shipowners wanted Japan ""opened up"" for trade, so that American ships could call there for food and water on voyages to Asia and could put in there in emergencies without being punished. They were also concerned that American sailors cast away on the Japanese coast were imprisoned as criminals.
American merchants saw in the British opening of China to trade an example of the ""benefits of new trade markets."" Fillmore and Secretary of State Daniel Webster dispatched Commodore Matthew C. Perry to open Japan to relations with the outside world. Though Perry did not reach Japan until after the end of Fillmore's term, Fillmore ordered the Perry Expedition, and its success is to his credit.
Fillmore was also a staunch opponent of European meddling in Hawaii. France under Napoleon III attempted to annex Hawaii, but backed down after Fillmore issued a strongly worded message suggesting that ""the United States would not stand for any such action.""
Though President Taylor had signed the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty preventing Britain and the U.S. from acquiring new possessions in the Americas, Great Britain and the United States were still attempting to gain ground in the region. The situation became tense enough that Fillmore ordered several warships to guard American merchants in an attempt to prevent British interference.
Fillmore had difficulties regarding Cuba. Many southerners wanted to expand slave territory in the U.S., but the Missouri Compromise and other laws prevented that. Cuba was a colony of Spain where slavery was practiced. Therefore, some of these southerners tried to get Cuba annexed to the U.S. as a slave state. Venezuelan adventurer Narciso López recruited Americans for three ""filibustering"" expeditions to Cuba, in the hope of overthrowing Spanish rule there. His first attempt in 1849 was suppressed by U.S. officials by orders of President Taylor. López tried again a year later; he reached Cuba but was chased away by Spanish troops and disbanded his force in Key West. López and several of his followers were indicted for breach of the Neutrality Act, but were quickly acquitted by friendly Southern juries.
Many southerners felt Fillmore should have supported the invasion, while some northern Democrats were upset at his apology to Spain. France and Britain dispatched warships to the region in response. Fillmore sent a stern warning saying that under certain conditions control of Cuba ""might be almost essential to our [America's] safety."" López tried a third time in 1851. This time most of his force was captured by the Spanish. He and many of his American followers were executed, provoking outrage among American sympathizers and causing further embarrassment for Fillmore.
Another issue that came up during Fillmore's presidency was the arrival of Lajos Kossuth, the exiled leader of a failed Hungarian revolution. Kossuth wanted the U.S. to recognize Hungary's independence. Many Americans were sympathetic to the Hungarian rebels, especially recent German immigrants, who were now coming to the U.S. in large numbers and had become a major political force. This would require the U.S. to abandon its policy of nonintervention in European affairs. Fillmore ultimately refused to change American policy, and remained neutral.
Election of 1852 and completion of term
As the election of 1852 approached, Fillmore had been long undecided whether to run for a full term as President. In early 1852, he decided he would. The Whigs held their National Convention in June that year. Fillmore was then unpopular with northern Whigs for signing and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act. He led narrowly on the early ballots, but was short of a majority and could gain no votes. On the 52nd ballot, Daniel Webster's delegates switched to GeneralWinfield Scott, winning him the nomination on the 53rd ballot.
Democrat Franklin Pierce defeated Scott in the November election. Fillmore completed his term and was succeeded by Pierce on March 4, 1853.
Post-presidency
Abigail Fillmore caught a cold at the outdoor inaugural ceremonies for Franklin Pierce. She developed pneumonia and died just 26 days after leaving the White House, on March 30, 1853, at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C., the shortest post-Presidential life of any former first lady. Then, on July 26, 1854, Fillmore's daughter Mary died suddenly of cholera. Later that year, Fillmore went abroad. While touring Europe in 1855, Fillmore was offered an honoraryDoctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree by the University of Oxford. Fillmore turned down the honor, explaining that he had neither the ""literary nor scientific attainment"" to justify the degree. He is also quoted as having explained that he ""lacked the benefit of a classical education"" and could not, therefore, understand the Latin text of the diploma, adding that he believed ""no man should accept a degree he cannot read."" Another possibility is that Fillmore refused the degree in order to escape the heckling and taunting to which Oxford students typically subjected the recipients of such honors. In fact, Fillmore had been awarded an honorary LL.D. from Geneva College in 1850; he accepted, even though its text was in Latin.
While in Europe, he also met with Pope Pius IX in Rome.
1856 campaign
When Fillmore returned to the U.S., the Whig Party had broken up over slavery issues and especially the Kansas–Nebraska Actof 1854. Most former northern Whigs, including Fillmore's old mentor Weed, joined the new Republican Party. Fillmore instead followed conservative and southern Whigs by accepting the nomination of the American Party, the political organ of the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic Know-Nothing movement. Fillmore was not himself anti-Catholic – his daughter Mary had attended a girls' Catholic boarding school for a year and he contributed to the construction of St. Joseph Cathedral in Buffalo – but at this time, the American Party was the only alternative for non-Democrats who were not militantly anti-slavery.
Historian Allan Nevins says Fillmore was not a Know-Nothing or a nativist. He was out of the country when the nomination came and had not been consulted about running. Furthermore, ""By no spoken or written word had he indicated a subscription to American tenets."" He sought national unity and felt the American Party was the ""only hope of forming a truly national party, which shall ignore this constant and distracting agitation of slavery.""
The American Party chose Fillmore as its presidential nominee for the election of 1856. He thus sought a nonconsecutive second term as president (a feat accomplished only once, by Grover Cleveland). His running mate was Andrew Jackson Donelson, nephew of former president Andrew Jackson. James Buchanan and John C. Breckinridge were the Democratic candidates, and won 1,836,072 votes (45.3%) and 174 electoral votes (19 states carried). John C. Fremont and William L. Dayton were the Republican candidates and won 1,342,345 votes (33.1%) and 114 electoral votes (11 states carried). Fillmore and Donelson finished third, winning 873,053 votes (21.6%) and carrying the state of Maryland and its 8 electoral votes. This was one of the best showings ever by a third-party presidential candidate.
Later life
Fillmore was one of the founders of the University at Buffalo. The school was chartered by an act of the New York State Legislature on May 11, 1846, and at first was only a medical school. Fillmore was the first Chancellor, a position he held as Vice President and as President. After leaving politics, Fillmore returned to Buffalo and continued to serve as chancellor of the school.
On February 10, 1858, Fillmore married Caroline McIntosh, a wealthy widow. Their combined wealth allowed them to purchase a big house in Buffalo, New York. They were noted for lavish hospitality in their home, until Mrs. Fillmore's health began to decline in the 1860s.
In the election of 1860, Fillmore supported Constitutional Union Party candidate John Bell. He denounced secession, and, once the American Civil War began, supported the Union war effort, but also became a constant critic of the war policies of President Abraham Lincoln, such as the Emancipation Proclamation.
Fillmore helped found the Buffalo Historical Society (now the Buffalo History Museum) in 1862 and served as its first president. He commanded the Union Continentals, a corps of home guards of males over the age of 45 from the upstate New York area. The Continentals trained to defend the Buffalo area in the event of a Confederate attack, as happened in the St. Albans Raid, and was planned for Johnson's Island. They performed military drill and ceremonial functions at parades, funerals, and other events. The Union Continentals guarded Lincoln's funeral train in Buffalo. They continued operations after the war, and Fillmore remained active with them almost until his death.
In the 1864 presidential election Fillmore supported Democratic candidate George B. McClellan for the presidency, believing that the Democratic Party's plan for immediate cessation of fighting and allowing the seceded states to return with slavery intact was the best possibility for restoring the Union.
Fillmore also maintained a correspondence with Franklin Pierce, in which they agreed with each other that Lincoln had overstepped his authority and encouraged each other to find ways to thwart Lincoln's war policy.
Fillmore's reputation as a Lincoln critic caused a crowd to gather outside his house after Lincoln's assassination. Spattering his house with ink, they demanded to know why Fillmore hadn't draped his house in black bunting as a sign of mourning for Lincoln. Fillmore asked for understanding, explaining that he was at the bedside of his ill wife, and did not know of Lincoln's death. His explanation satisfied the crowd, which soon departed.
After the war, Fillmore maintained his conservative position. He supported President Andrew Johnson's conservative Reconstruction policies, and opposed the policies of the Radical Republicans.
He died at 11:10 pm on March 8, 1874, of the aftereffects of a stroke. His last words were alleged to be, upon being fed some soup, ""the nourishment is palatable."" On January 7 each year, a ceremony is held at his grave site in the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo.
Legacy
Some northern Whigs remained irreconcilable, refusing to forgive Fillmore for having signed the Fugitive Slave Act. They helped deprive him of the Presidential nomination in 1852. Within a few years it was apparent that although the Compromise had been intended to settle the slavery controversy, it served rather as an uneasy sectional truce. Robert J. Rayback argues that the appearance of a truce, at first, seemed very real as the country entered a period of prosperity that included the South. Although Fillmore, in retirement, continued to feel that conciliation with the South was necessary and considered that the Republican Party was at least partly responsible for the subsequent disunion, he was an outspoken critic of secession and was also critical of President James Buchanan for not immediately taking military action when South Carolina seceded.
Benson Lee Grayson suggests that the Fillmore administration's ability to avoid potential problems is too often overlooked. Fillmore's constant attention to Mexico avoided a resumption of the hostilities that had only broken off in 1848 and laid the groundwork for the Gadsden Treaty during Pierce's administration. Meanwhile, the Fillmore administration resolved a serious dispute with Portugal left over from the Taylor administration, smoothed over a disagreement with Peru, and then peacefully resolved other disputes with Britain, France, and Spain over Cuba. At the height of this crisis, the Royal Navy had fired on an American ship while at the same time 160 Americans were being held captive in Spain. Fillmore and his State Department were able to resolve these crises without the United States going to war or losing face.
Because the Whig party was so deeply divided, and the two leading national figures in the Whig party (Fillmore and his own Secretary of State, Daniel Webster) refused to combine to secure the nomination, Winfield Scott received it. Because both the north and the south refused to unite behind Scott, he won only four of 31 states, and lost the election to Franklin Pierce. After Scott's defeat, the Whigs' decline continued, until the party broke up over the Kansas–Nebraska Act, and the Know Nothings appeared.
In the history of the U.S. Presidency, Fillmore inaugurated a new era. All previous Presidents had substantial personal fortunes, acquired either by inheritance, marriage, or (in Martin van Buren's case) by work as an attorney. Fillmore was the first of a long line of late nineteenth century chief executives, mostly lawyers, who acquired only modest wealth during their lives, were ""distinctly middle class"", and who spent most of their careers in public service.
A popular story claims, incorrectly, that Fillmore installed the White House's first bathtub.
While Fillmore's letters and papers are dispersed among multiple institutions. The largest surviving collection is in the Research Library at the Buffalo History Museum.
On February 18, 2010, the United States Mint released the thirteenth coin in the Presidential $1 Coin Program, bearing Fillmore's likeness. A total of 74,480,000 coins were produced.

smconsultingllc,9/8/2016 17:05,"Cougar nation's favorite funnyman Boney Fuller recounts a visit with Swoop earlier this week in preparation for Saturday's rivalry match-up against the Utah Utes.
I’ve been trying to get ahold of Swoop for weeks with no luck. The first number I found turned out to be for the Philadelphia Eagles mascot, who politely told me in a caustic Northeastern accent to “go get [redacted for the children], jagweed.” Right attitude, wrong Swoop. After that, it was the Miami University mascot who, after checking a couple times to make sure I wasn’t trying to reach the University of Miami, got really, really excited. It broke my heart to tell him that he was the wrong Swoop. Eastern Michigan Swoop was obviously drunk, Eastern Washington Swoop didn’t know it was a mascot. Then there was Emory University Swoop, and finally the South Bend Silver Hawks Swoop (baseball’s only Swoop). I was close to giving up, but my persistence has finally paid off; the phone is ringing and I think I’ve got my man. Bird. Manbird.
We go through a brief introduction and before long, I’m desperately trying to convince him to give me an interview. He keeps telling me it’s a short week before the Holy War and there’s just no time. Finally, he gives in and tells me he’s willing to compromise. “If you want an interview, meet me at the Utah State Fairgrounds on Tuesday and I’ll give you a two-for-one special.” He refuses to explain and hangs up quickly and I’m left confused but grateful. It’s always a tightrope walk catering to the egos and schedules of even regional school mascots.
It’s a warm, dry September morning as I stroll toward the fairgrounds for my interview. I can see Swoop waiting for me near the entrance but it takes me a second to realize it’s him. That may be surprising given the fact that there are relatively few anthropomorphic hawks hanging around most places you go. In this case, though, Swoop is neither the most unique looking individual milling about the dusty fairground gates, nor is he wearing his signature Utah jersey with its characteristic “mountains drawn by a paste-eating third grader” sleeves. Instead he’s draped head to toe in a combination of black and neon green and his drab yellow beak is blackened with what I’d later learn was his dad’s shoe polish. With his bobblehead physique and bulging eyes, he looks every bit like a baby bird that fell into a bonfire. He waves me over.
“Let me tell you something,” he says as I approach, my eyes darting in every direction to try to capture each detail as a group of fleshy black pincushion types make their way through the entrance. In the distance I can hear music that sounds vaguely like someone put a Papa Roach CD in a blender. “In the late 90s I had a lot of offers from a lot of teams looking down the barrel of political correctness. Basically any school with a football team and a Native American-themed mascot was looking for a new team name and for some reason everyone wanted birds. But I chose Utah. You want to know why?” I do. He raises his arms and gestures at the scene that surrounds us. “Because Utah’s the only place where I knew I could do my job and be myself. Where I’d never have to compromise my membership in the Family. Welcome to the Gathering. Whoop whoop.”
I have no idea what he’s talking about. He ushers me through the gates and I’m starting to get a little nervous. As we walk through the fairgrounds under the intense late summer sunlight, Swoop explains. It turns out the Gathering is some kind of annual pilgrimage for a group of lifestyle aficionados who call themselves juggalos. From what I can see, the Gathering is essentially some kind of communal Cirque de Soleil, if the theme of Cirque de Soleil were diabetes. Everywhere I look, mounds of unkempt flesh are spilling out of black bodices, black corsets, or over the tops of JNCO jeans like waterfalls of skin and fat in suspended animation.
“Um, Swoop,” I start to say, and he stops and gives me a serious look. ""Listen, I need to explain something to you,"" he says imploringly. I'm taken aback by the gravity of his tone. ""Out there,"" he points toward the fairground gates that lead to a world I'm beginning to miss very much. ""Out there, I'm Swoop. But in here I'm Woop. As in 'Whoop whoop.' Out there, it's four downs. In here, the only down is what you are with the clown."" Chastised, I hold my questions and let him continue to lead me through the open-sky corridors of the Gathering, past a tent that says “Juggalos for Jesus” and another that says “Free Lap Dance With T-Shirt Purchase.”
I’m astounded by the number of people that Swoop, or Woop, knows at the Gathering. Everywhere we go someone’s stopping to say hello, give him a hug, or reveal to him some newly pierced anatomical protuberance. He introduces me to all of them and I have to say I come away from the tour with my nascent ideas on juggalos radically altered. These are salt of the earth people, working class bohemians that never seem to notice or care that I’m wearing a button down shirt to their nightmare clown hootenanny. They’re welcoming and warm almost without exception, until I ask if Faygo comes in any diet flavors. If it does, no one was sharing.
At the end of a long, sweaty day full of awkward introductions and a lot of inadvertent cannabis inhalation, Swoop leads me to the fairground exit. We haven’t talked football even once, haven’t discussed the Holy War, Utah’s chances in the Pac 12, or Swoop’s budding rivalry with Cosmo Cougar. None of it seems to matter here at the Gathering, where the only thing Swoop can focus on is the litany of “Family” members that surround him.
“These are my people,” he tells me as he licks powdered sugar off of a funnel cake. “This is what you guys don’t get at BYU. This is why you’re not building a base in a diversifying Utah population. It’s not just the fact that we started playing Twizted songs on Third Downs, or that our stadium drinks are provided by Faygo. It’s not the free Valtrex at the University of Utah student clinic, or the Arby’s coupons on the back of the free tickets. It’s not even our insistence that neither the Holy War nor college football in general really existed before the 21st century. More than anything, it’s that we don’t judge these people. At the U, we welcome all these people with open arms. You could really learn something from that at BYU.”
The thing is, he’s right. It’s all I can think about as I walk down the dark streets toward my car. I came to meet Swoop hoping to get something, anything, I could use as more ammo in the endless security dilemma of rivalry smack that characterizes the Holy War. But instead what I got was a lesson on human kindness.

Rob DeMello,9/8/2016 17:10,"Nick Rolovich vs Portland State in 2000
Since 1978, when the NCAA was split into two levels, Division 1-A/FBS and Division 1-AA/FCS, the University of Hawaii football team has been nearly perfect against FCS or D1-AA opponents, owning a record of 21-1.
So with Ohio Valley Conference member UT Martin coming to town this weekend, one would imagine that overlooking a perceived lower-level foe would be an issue. However, that is certainly not the case with the 'Bows, since that one loss came in the UH football debut for current head coach Nick Rolovich.
The then-junior quarterback who won the starting QB job ahead of true freshman Timmy Chang, opened the 2000 season with teammates slot back Craig Stutzmann (current QB Coach), center Brian Smith (current offensive coordinator), cornerback Abraham Elimimian (current defensive backs coach), and defensive coordinator both then and now, Kevin Lempa, with a stunning 45-20 loss to Portland State.
Craig Stutzmann vs. Portland State in 2000
""That's not something to be proud of, you know,"" said Stutzmann. ""We talk about all the good times we had and I put that one out of my memory for life. It's a good life lesson for all of us, all joking aside. If we don't take care of the football, and we don't do the things we were coached and taught to do, then we're going to lose the game.""
The loss to the Vikings, a program that Stutzmann would end up making his collegiate coaching debut with in 2009, was especially stunning since it came after UH went 9-4 with an Oahu Bowl victory over Oregon State to complete the greatest single season turnaround in NCAA history, going from 0-12 in 1998.
""Well that game against Portland State man, the fans showed up, 45-plus thousand fans and we thought that we were just going to beat the daylights out of Portland State and that didn't happen, but I think this year we got to be focused. They're going to come in here and play hard, because they think they can beat us. For us, we've got to match and surpass their intensity and we have the coaches, we have the players. It's just about doing it in front of our fans,"" said Elimimian.
Rolovich and the rest of the Warriors would more than make up for the upset loss as Rolo, who was a two-year QB for Hawaii, led the team to a 9-3 record in 2001, leading the Warriors to an upset of their own over previously unbeaten and No. 9 BYU in the 2001 season finale, 72-45, with 543 yards and eight touchdowns. As a senior that season, he ranked 10th nationally in passing efficiency with a 150.5 rating and broke 19 school passing and eight total offense records. He ended his college career with three consecutive 500-yard passing games, engineering at least 52 points each outing.
However, that loss to Portland State will forever serve as a reminder, both good and bad, of what is possible.
""You can draw from that game and you can draw from last weekend, where FCS opponents beat plenty of FBS opponents, and a bunch gave guys games. I think there's good football being played at the FCS level and right now there is no one that we can take lightly,"" said Rolovich.
UT Martin last Thursday opened their season with a loss at Cincinnati, 28-7, a game that the Skyhawks led 7-6 in the third quarter.

mystateline.com,9/8/2016 17:11,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Dustin Hurst,9/8/2016 17:20,"
Dustin Hurst September 8, 2016 
Lucas Handy had no plans to get rich renting out a spare bedroom in his spacious Rexburg home. 
Instead, he and his wife Mary sought only to provide a place to stay for wandering travelers eager to see Yellowstone National Park or a non-traditional lodging solution for visiting parents of Brigham Young University-Idaho students. 
Lucas is fond of the numerous guests he and his wife have housed through the room-sharing service. 
“I can make friends with anyone across the world and offer them some of my resources at a super good rate,” he told IdahoReporter.com Wednesday. 
Lucas, who works at nearby Madison Memorial Hospital, said Mary ran the Airbnb operation as a family side project. 
“We didn’t really do it for income, we did it for fun,” Lucas said. “My wife did the work and I got to enjoy the company.” 
The couple, who have a young daughter, earned some income from the venture. The first month, he said, they earned $120 from their $30-per-night room rental. The final month, he added, that number was in the thousands. Mary reinvested all the revenue into their Rexburg home, upgrading amenities as she could. 
Lucas found more than money in sharing the room in his family home. He found new friends, exposure to different cultures and the chance to share something special to his heart: his Mormon faith. 
“I’ve given away 17 Book of Mormons,” he said. “The experience is hands-down the best.” 
He didn’t expect he’d fall in love with opening his home to strangers, 90 percent of whom he says hail from outside the U.S., but he’s now addicted. He wishes others would give Airbnb a chance because he believes it could do wonders. 
“If we do this right as a people, we are really loving our neighbor,” Lucas said. “We can touch the lives of anyone travelling. If everybody wanted to open up a spare room and become an awesome host, Rexburg could change thousands of lives for the better.” 
Those sentiments might resonate with his friends, neighbors and colleagues in the small Eastern Idaho town, which is home to BYU-I, a university owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Right now, though, Rexburg townspeople find themselves embroiled in a political flap not uncommon in cities across the country. With the rise of the sharing economy, families are increasingly employing non-traditional methods to share rooms, car rides or other items, often making money in the process. 
The Handy family, like several others in the area, used Airbnb to share a vacant bedroom in their home. 
They did, until they received a phone call in July from the city of Rexburg. The message: City zoning code forbids short-term rentals in low-density residential areas. Most single-family housing in the town, then, cannot offer rentals through Airbnb. 
Lucas said Mary took the call, and immediately “felt bad” and removed the listing from the website. They don’t want to disobey the law, so they’ve ceased their operation. 
But the family wants a change, as do many in the community. Yet, others think the town should conserve its quiet heritage and continue the ban on short-term lodging rentals. Since EastIdahoNews.com profiled the Handy family days ago, numerous Rexburg residents have taken sides and discussed the matter on social media. 
Some worry that allowing the rentals will disturb the town’s peaceful, sleepy culture. They believe incoming guests will crowd residential streets with extra cars and disturb the peace with raucous parties. 
Alternatively, some wonder if the city’s zoning codes intrude on private property rights, especially if guests come and go quietly and follow all other parking and nuisance ordinances. 
Lucas thinks some in the community are “blowing things out of proportion,” though he’s trying to be a good neighbor and see opponents’ arguments. For his part, none of his neighbors have complained — directly to him or to the city — about the 27 times he has rented out the room. 
City leaders and officials have entered the fray. The Rexburg code enforcement office recently sent letters to a number of Airbnb hosts, asking them to cease their operations. Code Enforcement Office Natalie Powell told IdahoReporter.com many residents aren’t aware of the restriction and will likely follow the law once informed. 
Seeking to quell some of questions about the rentals, Rexburg Mayor Jerry Merrill posted his thoughts on social media Tuesday night. 
“I have personally visited with several people who have been renting rooms as well as some who have concerns about their neighborhoods and I have learned much that will help us as we try to come up with a workable solution,” Merrill wrote. 
“We realize that the world is changing and we may need to alter some of our rules and regulations in a way that will have the least negative impact on family neighborhoods.” 
Merrill told IdahoReporter.com he’s working hard to understand both sides of the issue. “We are very open to ideas right now,” he said. “We are not necessarily really landing on one side or the other. There are two sides of the coin.” 
Officials heard some feedback at a Rexburg City Council meeting Wednesday night, but the mayor hopes to fully address the issue at a later date, possibly as early as Sept. 21. 
Merrill hopes to handle the situation quickly to end the growing tension among his constituents. He also hopes a quick end will prevent Airbnb hosts, who ignore the city’s overtures, from being fined for breaking the code. 
Lucas and Mary Handy hope there’s a quick resolution, too. Lucas wants a middle-ground where he can continue renting the room in his home while still respecting his neighbors and their wishes for a peaceful co-existence. They should, he added, ask themselves if his rentals really harm them or infringe on their lifestyles. 
“If I am, let me know,” he said. “I want to be an amiable neighbor.” 
If the city can’t find a quick resolution, Lucas isn’t afraid to take an unusual step because he’s fallen so deeply in love with the Airbnb arrangement. 
“I would do it for free if they will let me,” he said. Join the discussion

ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (6) Logan • When Utah State visits USC on Saturday, the Aggies will see two familiar faces. Linebacker Porter Gustin of Salem Hills High School and Stevie Tu'ikolovatu, a nose guard who transferred from the University of Utah, are expected to start for the Trojans. In last week's 52-6 loss at Alabama, Gustin tied for the team-high in tackles with nine, including one sack. Tu'ikolovatu finished with two tackles. Gustin (6-5, 260) was an early Utah State recruit. He met with coach Matt Wells in the Aggie football offices when he was a junior at Salem Hills — before becoming a national recruit. VIDEOS TOP JOBS ""We were his first official offer,"" Wells said. ""… He is a tremendous young man and comes from a great family. It is neat to watch him because he's a Utah kid and we recruited him. ""He plays unbelievably hard and gives a fanatical effort. He turns and chases the ball down the line, he knows angles, he can rush the passer and he's long."" Wells compared Gustin to former Aggie Kyler Fackrell, who was a third-round pick in last summer's NFL draft. ""… You better be aware of him,"" Wells said. Tu'ikolovatu played high school football at East. He graduated from Utah last year. As a result, he was able to transfer to USC without sitting out a season. ""We know all about him,"" Wells said. ""I have a lot of respect for that young man."" Utah State center Austin Stephens battled Tu'ikolovatu during Utah's 24-14 win over Utah State last season. ""He rotated with that [defensive] front down there in Salt Lake City,"" Stephens said. ""They were one of the better Pac-12 fronts that you saw last year. He's very talented. He's a load. You look at him, he's 6-1 and 320. That's a big boy. He's stout. He does a lot of good things. We'll just see what we can do."" A third Utah high school player, linebacker Osa Masina of Brighton, won't play against the Aggies. He has been suspended for the second straight game while under investigation for a sexual assault charge. Leavitt to be a major defensive factor at safety Dallin Leavitt started his college career at BYU before transferring to Utah State. Leavitt is the Aggies' starting boundary safety. He had six tackles and an interception in last week's 45-6 win over Weber State and proved, as expected, he will be a major contributor this season. Leavitt attended Central Catholic High School in Portland before being recruited to BYU by former coach Bronco Mendenhall. ""BYU, we just didn't see eye-to-eye, I guess is the best way to put it,"" he said. ""It was just a tough culture for me. Living in Provo, for me, it's a different place. It's a special place and you have to be a special person to live there and I just didn't fit that mold. … I just felt like it was better for me if I left.""

Send up to 5 emails, separate emails with a comma Sender Email * NOTEBOOK: Cameron’s College Connection TO Carroll; Other Notes Posted 3 hours ago Jordan Cameron will be facing his former college coach Sunday when the Dolphins take on Pete Carroll and the Seattle Seahawks, but this isn’t your average reunion. Cameron put it simply when asked what stood out from his time with Carroll at USC in 2008-09. “He’s the reason that I’m here now,” Cameron said. Indeed, if it hadn’t been for Pete Carroll, chances are Cameron never would have played college football, therefore never would have played in the NFL. Remember that Cameron was a basketball player at Brigham Young University when he started playing college sports, but that changed when he went out to run routes for his younger brother Colby, a high school quarterback looking to get noticed. Except it was Jordan that Carroll and assistant Steve Sarkisian noticed that day in May 2007 and even though they weren’t allowed to talk to him because he was under scholarship at another school, they found a way to make it clear they thought he had a future in football. “I never thought I’d be playing football ever again after high school,” Cameron said. “Long story short, he’s the reason I’m playing now. He recruited me. I guess he has a lot to do with my whole career. It’s going to be cool playing against him. I played against him my rookie year, so I’m familiar with it and I know he’s going to get those guys right and they’re going to be ready to roll.” As fate would have it, Cameron’s game against Carroll and the Seahawks in 2011 marked his NFL debut after he had been a fourth-round pick of the Cleveland Browns that spring. Cameron didn’t catch any passes that day as a backup behind starting tight ends Ben Watson and Alex Smith. Cameron has come a long way since then, with a Pro Bowl on his resume, fulfilling the promise that Pete Carroll saw in him almost a decade ago. “When I got to USC, he saw my high school tape and saw my junior college tape and he’s like, you look comfortable at receiver, we’ll try you out there and then we’ll move you to tight end as you get older and gain a little more weight,” Cameron said. “And then he left (in 2010) and (Lane) Kiffin switched me to tight end. “After I got my release (from BYU), I talked to him and he just said he saw just an athletic guy that was fluid, was big enough and I thought I had a frame to gain some more weight and they just thought I had a shot at the NFL and I could be a threat at tight end.” DEALING WITH CENTURYLINK In addition to facing one of the best teams in the NFL in recent years, the Dolphins also will have to play at one of the loudest, toughest venues in the league Sunday. CenturyLink Field, with its “12th Man,” has earned the reputation as one of the most challenging places to play, but former Seahawks cornerback Byron Maxwell refuses to make a big deal about it. “Really, I don't address stuff like that,” he said. “I treat it as a normal away game. The first game of the season, you'll have some jitters. It's just going out there and having fun. Football is football. If you make it bigger than what it should be, that's when you start to get into trouble. You need to run and hit and play ball. That's it."" Veteran offensive lineman has played just about everywhere during his nine NFL seasons, and he listed Seattle, New Orleans and Kansas City as having the loudest stadiums in the NFL. He says communication will be key for the Dolphins on Sunday. “We have to make sure up front that our communication is on point,” he said. “That’s what we’re working toward every day here at practice. We all have to be on the same page, and that’s not just offensive line, that’s everyone on the offense. We all have to be on the same page, and we can’t let the noise be a distraction.” Dolphins players who have never played in Seattle have been told what to expect Sunday. “It’s a tough place to play,” quarterback Ryan Tannehill said. “I obviously haven’t played there yet, but it has a reputation, and it’s for a reason. Some guys in the locker room played there, and they’ll tell you it’s one of the loudest places — if not the loudest in the league — you’ll play. We understand that going in there, it’s going to be a tough place to play, but we have to find a way to overcome that and find a way to win.” As one would expect given his feisty personality and style, wide receiver Jarvis Landry is looking forward to playing in that kind of frenzied atmosphere. “I think for me, being in the craziest environments that I’ve been in has been the atmosphere that I’ve been in in college,” he said. “I get that vibe a lot just hearing from guys who’ve played there — it kind of feels like a college atmosphere. I tend to thrive in those venues, so I’m excited about the crowd, the challenge and I’m excited about our team, to go in there and compete.” LAST WORD DT Ndamukong Suhh on how different the intensity is between preseason games and regular season games: “We call it live bullets. At the end of the day, we were shooting blanks in preseason — just working on our craft and focusing on individual things. All these games particularly count now. The intensity just goes up. Say, if we’re at 100 for preseason, we’re going up to 150.” Trending Now

BYU releases 2017 gymnastics schedule Kristen Kerr   8, 2016 11:43 AM | Updated Sep 8, 2016 11:59 AM (Photo by BYU Photo) 
PROVO, Utah – BYU gymnastics released its 2017 schedule, including five home meets and a mixture of Mountain Rim Gymnastics Conference and nonconference meets throughout the season. 
The nonconference schedule is highlighted by home meets against two Pac-12 opponents and both a home and away meet against two members of the Big Ten Conference. The Cougars will also compete in Texas, the home state of a few BYU gymnasts. 
“I’m really excited that we’re having more home meets,” BYU head coach Guard Young said. “The Arizona and Iowa teams that are coming in are going to be fun and different. We don’t see them every single season.” 
The annual Blue and White Intrasquad meet will be held Friday, Dec. 9, before the season kicks off. The Cougars open their season on Friday, Jan. 13, against in-state rival University of Utah at the Marriott Center. 
“We’re embracing hosting Utah opening weekend,” Young said. “What a cool way to start the season by bringing in such a high-profile team.” 
BYU hosts Utah State the following week (Jan. 20) before heading to the Gem State Invitational in Boise (Jan. 27). 
February competition begins with two away meets, including a tri-meet against Utah State and Denver in Logan (Feb. 3). The Cougars then travel to Texas Woman’s University (Feb. 11) before returning to Provo for a pair of home meets. BYU hosts Southern Utah (Feb. 18) and Iowa (Feb. 24). The month ends with a trip to Southern Utah on Feb. 27. 
The Cougars compete against Minnesota in Minneapolis (March 4) before coming home to face Arizona (March 10) in the final regular season meet. The MRCG championships will be held March 18 at Utah State.

NASA's Cassini spacecraft has radar vision that allows it to peer through the haze that surrounds Saturn's largest moon, Titan. This video focuses on Shangri-la, a large, dark area on Titan filled with dunes. The long, linear dunes are thought to be comprised of grains derived from hydrocarbons that have settled out of Titan's atmosphere. 

Titan's Dunes and Other Features Emerge in New Images 
New scenes from a frigid alien landscape are coming to light in recent radar images of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Cassini obtained the views during a close flyby of Titan on July 25, when the spacecraft came as close as 607 miles (976 kilometers) from the giant moon. The spacecraft's radar instrument is able to penetrate the dense, global haze that surrounds Titan, to reveal fine details on the surface. One of the new views (along with a short video) shows long, linear dunes, thought to be comprised of grains derived from hydrocarbons that have settled out of Titan's atmosphere. Cassini has shown that dunes of this sort encircle most of Titan's equator. Scientists can use the dunes to learn about winds, the sands they're composed of, and highs and lows in the landscape. ""Dunes are dynamic features. They're deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,"" said Jani Radebaugh, a Cassini radar team associate at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Another new image shows an area nicknamed the ""Xanadu annex"" earlier in the mission by members of the Cassini radar team. Cassini's radar had not previously obtained images of this area, but earlier measurements by the spacecraft suggested the terrain might be quite similar to the large region on Titan named Xanadu. First imaged in 1994 by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, Xanadu was the first surface feature to be recognized on Titan. While Hubble was able to see Xanadu's outline, the annex area went unnoticed. The new Cassini image reveals that the Xanadu annex is, indeed, made up of the same type of mountainous terrains observed in Xanadu and scattered across other parts of Titan. ""This 'annex' looks quite similar to Xanadu using our radar, but there seems to be something different about the surface there that masks this similarity when observing at other wavelengths, as with Hubble,"" said Mike Janssen, also a JPL member of the radar team. ""It's an interesting puzzle."" Xanadu -- and now its annex -- remains something of a mystery. Elsewhere on Titan, mountainous terrain appears in small, isolated patches, but Xanadu covers a large area, and scientists have proposed a variety of theories about its formation. ""These mountainous areas appear to be the oldest terrains on Titan, probably remnants of the icy crust before it was covered by organic sediments from the atmosphere,"" said Rosaly Lopes, a Cassini radar team member at JPL. ""Hiking in these rugged landscapes would likely be similar to hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota."" The July 25 flyby was Cassini's 122nd encounter with Titan since the spacecraft's arrival in the Saturn system in mid-2004. It was also the last time Cassini's radar will image terrain in the far southern latitudes of Titan. ""If Cassini were orbiting Earth instead of Saturn, this would be like getting our last close view of Australia,"" said Stephen Wall, deputy lead of the Cassini radar team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Cassini's four remaining Titan flybys will focus primarily on the liquid-filled lakes and seas in Titan's far north. The mission will begin its finale in April 2017, with a series of 22 orbits that plunge between the planet and its icy rings. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. JPL designed, developed and assembled the Cassini orbiter. The radar instrument was built by JPL and the Italian Space Agency, working with team members from the U.S. and several European countries.

#ColinKaepernickSyllabus | New Black Man in ExileOn September 4, Rebecca Martinez tweeted Louis Moore and David J. Leonard, suggesting the creation of Colin Kaepernick Syllabus. Soon, we, along with  Bijan C. Bayne, Sarah J. Jackson, and many others began the work of creating a syllabus to hopefully elevate and empower the conversations that Colin Kaepernick started when he decided to sit down in protest during an August 26, 2016 preseason game.  Building on the framework established by Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha Blain, with their monumental #CharlestonSyllabus, Marcia Chatelain with #FergusonSyllabus and subsequent efforts from Candice Benbow with #LemonadeSyllabus and others who have sought to not only use social media and online technology to crowdsource and aggregate conversations, this syllabus represents an effort to bring  together multiple conversations, histories, disciplines, discourses, and spaces.  If we are going to follow Colin Kaepernick’s lead to have conversations and work toward justice, we must do so with the necessary tools and collective understanding.  This requires engaging multiple conversations, entering into these spaces with a historic foundation, with knowledge about the persistent realities of racial injustice and inequality, with insight into the longstanding struggles of the Black athlete.  This syllabus represents an attempt to aid in these conversations, to turn our everyday conversations, debates, and discourse into a classroom, all while making sure our institutionalized classrooms are engaged with the histories, struggles, and public discourses that shape our current moment.  Harry Edwards recently recently wrote, “silence is evil’s greatest and most consistently dependable ally.” For all those engaged in these conversations, for those who have written, spoke about, and organized around racial injustice, silence is antithetical to our work, our ethos.  Yet, too often people speak past one another; too many people presume because of the everyday saturation of sports culture, the ubiquity of media coverage of the Colin Kaepernick, and the hypervisibility (and invisibility) of racial discourse, along with the belief that this is all about opinions and “two sides” that they are prepared for these important conversations.   Too often, especially within the media and from those whose whiteness - their privilege - insulates, empowers, and protects, people speak without the requisite tools, without the requisite historic foundation, and without necessary information. This offers a toolbox of knowledge, links to resources, and information. The #Kaepernick syllabus furthers the efforts to disrupt the silence, to make connections, and to otherwise build on the work of Kaepernick, Edwards, members of the WNBA, Bomani Jones, Serena Williams, and so many others demanding that we speak and act.  While continuing the conversation is important, it must be done so with literacy and knowledge about American racism, the history of sports, the African American athlete, #BLM, protests, and so much more.  Discussions aren’t inherently transformative but with the requisite understanding, introspection about privilege and widely-held assumptions, and critical examination, we are better equipped as we walk toward justice and radical transformation #KapernickSyllabus #WeSitWithKaepThe Revolt of the Black AthleteHarry Edwards, The Revolt of Black Athlete, 1968Doug Hartmann, Race, Culture, and the Revolt of the Black athlete: The 1968 Olympic Protests and their Aftermath, 2003Sarah J.

Reading The Devil Is Due in Dreary as a Mormon text 
. 
David Parkin gave me a copy of The Devil Is Due in Dreary after my Comic-Con presentation. He’s a friend of a friend and we all ate dinner together, discussing the nature of being a Mormon and an artist and/or a Mormon artist. Also, I’m sad to share, I heard some unpleasant stories about bias against Mormons in Tinseltown. So there’s that. 
Anyway, The Devil Is Due in Dreary shares some surface traits with Pariah Missouri —terrifyingly authoritarian religious orders in a Western setting tinged with the supernatural. But Dreary is either modern or near-modern and thus Dreary the town isn’t merely frontier (as is Pariah), but isolated—a pocket of the past trapped in the modern world. 
Visually, the book is reasonably strong. The design of the devil is particularly good. The panel layouts frequently include needlessly baroque gewgaws that are attractive but distracting. The little missteps do mean that important visual elements—say, the fact that two main characters have similarly damaged faces—made me assume clutter rather than significance, which got in the way of proper reading. The style overall is reminiscent of early-to-mid-90s Image, if that’s your thing. 
I’m more interested today in the writing and story however, as Parkin promised me the possibility of a distinctly Mormon interpretation if read through that lens. 
Let’s begin with an excerpt from an interview Parkin gave about the book: = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — =— = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = — = 
RJS: The story has strong religious overtones to it, did you draw on personal experiences to layer that on the story, or are you looking at how the religious Right is acting out in modern-day society? 
David: It’s interesting, non-religious people usually see the book as a critical take on organized religion and religious people see it as a cautionary tale for those who follow too blindly. Personally, the message I want to convey is to beware of anyone who offers to do your thinking for you. That’s good advice no matter where your affiliations lie. 
The Devil is Due in Dreary: An interview with David Parkin 

That right there is a very Mormon statement, imho . And it offers a key that might correct a misreading like the one we see in this review (incidentally, I mostly agree with this review, but I do think it’s off thematically, leading it to more negative conclusions than I reach). 
So while there are Mormon ( or generically Judaeo-Christian) references, the most fruitful “Mormon reading” of the book comes through this idea that agency is primal and vital. 
In Mormon thought, we often think of “the devil” as someone who wished to curtail our agency before life ever began, more than as someone trying to get us to make bad choices now (we have both devils, of course, but the former gets more airplay in my experience). But that’s not how the devil in Dreary works. He just appears every decade or so to take the evil away—those who have already sinned; he’s more of a judge of how characters have already acted, rather than forcing or encouraging them to act in a certain way. 
The role of agency-denier then is wielded not by the Devil but by the town preacher. His power over the town is such that almost everyone does whatever he says. He proffers fear of the Devil as motivation, but in actual effect, it’s more peer pressure that keeps people in line. The townsfolk’s desire to fit in may thus the true thief of their agency. 
Let’s talk for a moment about those “non-religious people [who] usually see the book as a critical take on organized religion,” shall we? That’s a hard position to take unless you know virtually nothing about the realities and varieties of organized religion, but okay: let’s consider it anyway. 
Are our two outlaws who ride into town and see Dreary’s parishioners as a mindless, monstrous mass on to something? 
Well, the bugaboo of the 1860s West might have agreed. Here’s Brigham Young : “I am more afraid that this people have so much confidence in their leaders that they will not inquire for themselves of God whether they are lead by him.” 
But the thing about The Devil Is Due in Dreary is its seeming desire to have it both ways. It seems to place the onus of agency renegement on the leaders of the people, but any source of redemption—of reclaiming the power to choose—needs to come from the people. And when the Devil does come, he seems to hold the town’s leadership responsible for the sins of the people, but it’s the people who are left without an identity or path forward, having lost their leaders and their agency in one, fell, Devil-inflicted blow. 
Whether these muddled observations detract from the point or, in fact, are the point, I will leave as an exercise for the reader. Author: Theric Jepson .

Ward is also third on the team with 67 kills (3.72 per set). Junior middle blocker Marion Hazelwood is Oklahoma's best blocker with 29 total blocks (four solo, 25 assisted; 1.53 per set). Alford has dished out a team-high 314 assists (12.60 per set) and is also third on the team with 39 digs (1.56 per set). Redshirt sophomore defensive specialist Rachel Manriquez leads the Sooners with 81 digs (3.24 per set). Ward and Hazelwood represented Oklahoma on the Preseason All-Big 12 Conference Team. Hazelwood is a two-time AVCA All-America Honorable Mention and was a unanimous 2015 All-Big 12 First Team selection while Ward was a member of the Preseason All-Big 12 Team for a second year in a row after being a unanimous 2014 All-Big 12 First Team honoree.Alford was named the Big 12 Conference Offensive Player of the Week for her efforts last weekend at the UALR Tournament. She was named to the All-UALR Tournament Team after dishing out a Big 12-leading 13.50 assists per set. Alford collected 58 assists to set the program record for assists in a four-set match during the rally-scoring era in the win over Arkansas-Little Rock. She then dropped 66 assists to claim that record as well in the five-set victory over Mississippi State. Oklahoma enters the third weekend of the 2016 season ranking as the top team in country in hitting percentage (.368; 377 kills-90 errors-780 total attacks) as well as ranking fourth in the nation in assists per set (14.16) and eighth in kills per set (15.08). SCOUTING TEXAS-SAN ANTONIO (3-3) Ohio is a perfect 2-0 (1.000) all-time against Texas-San Antonio. The Bobcats and the Roadrunners last faced off on Sept. 17, 2010, in the Nike Invitational in Forth Worth, Texas -- a 3-0 win for Ohio.Laura Neugebauer-Groff is in her 15th season as the head coach at Texas-San Antonio. The Roadrunners were picked to finish second in Conference USA in the league's preseason poll. Texas-San Antonio put together a 24-9 (13-3 C-USA) campaign in 2015. The Roadrunners were downed by Western Kentucky, 3-1 (25-17, 25-19, 20-25, 25-21), in the Conference USA tournament title match.The Roadrunners went 0-3 last weekend in the American Campus Classic in Austin, Texas. Texas-San Antonio was swept by No. 3-ranked Texas, 3-0 (27-25, 25-23, 25-21) last Thursday, suffered a tough 3-2 (13-25, 22-25, 25-20, 26-24, 15-12) defeat at the hands of Miami on Friday, then ended the weekend by coming up on the losing end of a 3-0 (25-12, 25-19, 25-23) decision to Army on Saturday.Senior outside hitter Dajana Boskovic leads Texas-San Antonio with 77 kills (4.28 per set), is tied with freshman defensive specialist Emily Ramirez for the team lead with 48 digs and ranks second on the squad with 15 total blocks (two solo, 13 assisted; 0.83 per set). Ramirez is also tied with sophomore defensive specialist Shelby Williams for the team lead with 10 service aces. Junior outside hitter Marijeta Runjic is second on the squad with 57 kills (2.71 per set) and sophomore outside hitter Antonela Jularic is third with 40 kills (2.22 per set). Freshman middle hitter Kara Teal leads the Roadrunners with 19 total blocks (two solo, 17 assisted; 1.00 per set) while senior middle hitter Tessa Dahnert is third with 12 total blocks (one solo, 11 assisted; 0.63 per set) and Runjic is fourth with 10 total blocks (10 assisted; 0.48 per set). Senior setter Jessica Waldrip has distributed a team-high 168 assists (9.33 per set). SUCCESS IN THE CLASSROOM Ohio earned the AVCA Team Academic Award for the 2015-16 season, as announced by the organization on July 25.The award, which was initiated in the 1992-93 academic year, honors collegiate and high school volleyball teams that displayed excellence in the classroom during the school year by maintaining at least a 3.30 cumulative team grade-point average on a 4.0 scale or a 4.10 cumulative team GPA on a 5.0 scale. The Bobcats achieved the honor for a sixth time in the last seven seasons.Ashy, Bull, Gilleland, Kosiorek, Salis and middle blocker/outside hitter Shelby Walker (Bradenton, Fla.) represented Ohio on the 2015 Academic All-Mid-American Conference Team, with Ashy, Bull, Gilleland and Kosiorek earning MAC Distinguished Scholar-Athlete recognition. UP NEXT The Bobcats wrap up their non-conference tournament tour with a drive to Blacksburg, Va., to participate in the Hokie Invitational next Friday (Sept. 16). Ohio will battle Radford at 11 a.m. ET, then clash with host Virginia Tech at 8 p.m. ET. #BleedGreen

In this photo taken March 21, 2016, the Flint Water Plant water tower is seen in Flint, Mich. President Barack Obama next week will make his first trip to Flint, Mich. since the impoverished city was found to have lead-tainted drinking water, the White House said Wednesday, April 27, 2016. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) syndication.ap.org
The water crisis in Flint, Michigan highlights a number of serious problems: a public health outbreak, inadequate urban infrastructure, environmental injustice and political failures.
But when it comes to recovery, the central challenge, and one that has received relatively little attention, is our lack of useful information and understanding.
Who is most at risk? Where are the harmful sources of lead? Where should resources be allocated? Using modern big-data tools, we can answer these questions and help inform the response to this crisis.
With the support of our student team at the University of Michigan , we have aggregated a trove of available data around Flint’s water issues, including water test results, records of the service lines that deliver water to homes, information on parcels of land and water usage. Leveraging new algorithmic and statistical tools, we are able to produce a significantly more complete picture of the risks and challenges in Flint.
These methods strongly resemble those used by Facebook, Amazon and other large tech companies who collect vast amounts of data from users.
But whereas Facbeook’s algorithms crunch through uploaded photographs to detect faces and Amazon’s models predict which products you’ll like, we are using these analytics tools to detect homes with high risk of lead contamination and to predict the locations of lead pipes buried underground or hidden in the homes of residents.
What have we learned? Here are a few takeaways from our research.
Lead contamination varies widely across homes and is highly scattered around Flint, but it is surprisingly predictable The headlines on Flint could easily lead one to believe all homes in the city have dangerously high levels of lead. But in fact, using data from the state’s sentinel program , we found during a period in February only between 8 and 15 percent of homes had lead above the federal action level of 15 parts per billion (ppb).
Indeed, things have been improving from January through August 2016, according to the test data from the sentinel program. Based on about 750 homes monitored repeatedly, fewer homes have tested above the action level over time. Almost half of all samples have virtually no detectable level (below 1 parts per billion).
Percent of samples in the DEQ’s sentinel program that tested below the federal action level. Jonathan Stroud, Ph.D. student at UM.
These low numbers provide little comfort when we don’t know which homes are at risk. Only around 30 percent of homes in Flint have had their water tested, according to government data, and these water tests do not guarantee safety; they only identify danger. Also, it is clear from the data that homes that are slower to sample their water tend to be those at much greater risk.
So can we find these homes? The answer is yes, to a modest degree of accuracy. We have built statistical models that profile a home based on several attributes (year of construction, location, value, size, etc.), and provide an estimate of the risk level.
Based on our statistical models, we can display locations which we estimate to be at high risk of lead contamination. Jared Webb, Ph.D. student at Brigham Young University
The quality of these models is driven by the huge swaths of data from water samples submitted by residents and tested by government officials in response to the crisis. This provides us with a database of measurements that includes over 20,000 water samples covering roughly 10,000 homes in Flint since November 2015 to present. We have made our risk assessments available to government officials, and are being incorporated into an mobile application, funded by Google and built by students at UM Flint, that allows Flint residents to learn of their home’s risk level.
Younger properties have lower lead levels, on average and based on the 90th percentile (blue line). There were 8 percent of tests above federal action level 15 ppb (dotted red), and still some well above 150 ppb and even 1000 ppb. The highest 0.5 percent of samples are not shown. The Conversation US
These statistical models not only provide predictions; they also give a better understanding of the problems. This has much broader implications, as these factors predicting lead may generalize beyond Flint.
The data suggest that lead contamination is associated with a number of factors; older homes tend to be at greater risk, for instance, as are those of lower home value. Lower-value homes also tend to be those with the lowest rates of water sampling. Additionally, while the highest readings are geographically scattered, the homes predicted to be at high risk tend to cluster in specific neighborhoods.
Flint’s lead pipe records are spotty and noisy, but statistical methods can significantly fill the gap Media reports and political efforts have continued to focus on the so-called “water service lines” that connect each house to the distribution system in the street. The assumption is that homes with lead service lines are most at risk for lead exposure and poisoning. As a result, much of the attention has been on locating and replacing these lines.
The Michigan legislature has allocated over US$25 million toward replacing the harmful lines, beginning with a pilot phase of roughly 250 homes . This effort is being headed up by a team under National Guard Brig. Gen. Michael McDaniel .
The problem, however, is not only with lines made out of lead material: Lead particulate can accumulate on the walls of corroded galvanized steel pipes. Pipes made of copper or plastic, on the other hand, are generally considered to be safe.
But there are immediate challenges with the line replacement program. And the most obvious is: Where are these dangerous pipes?
The city, unfortunately, did not maintain consistent records on service line installations and materials. But city officials eventually found, after some searching, a set of maps with handwritten annotations (last updated in 1984), and these records were digitized by a UM Flint research team lead by Professor Marty Kaufman . These appeared to identify the material of the service lines for most home parcels in Flint.
Using paper records, researchers were able to get a rough idea of what type of material – lead, copper or plastic – was used to bring water service to home. Jacob Abernethy and Eric Schwartz
How complete and accurate are these records? Unfortunately, not very. For over 30 percent of homes, either there are missing labels or the records disagree with a home inspection of a portion of the service line.
We can again fill in gaps with the help of algorithms and data. Looking for patterns in the existing records, statistical tools can provide a reasonable “educated guess” as to the type of material in a home’s service line. We have been working directly with Gen. Michael McDaniel’s line replacement team, providing statistical estimates of where lead pipes are most likely to be found, and this has guided their targeting of replacement resources.
Our recommendations are adapting to incoming data, using techniques applied in online advertising experiments or clinical trials, to identify the risky homes quickly and efficiently.
Professors Schwartz (left) and Abernethy (right) at a service line replacement site in Flint, Michigan. The Conversation US
Our machine learning techniques, which utilize all of the available city data, parcel records and a database of over 3,000 inspection reports, are able to estimate line materials with better than 80 percent accuracy. We find, for instance, that houses built in the 1920s to 1940s are many times more likely than those built after 1960 to have lead in their service line. Our guesses aren’t perfect by any means, but estimates of this level can save millions of dollars on recovery efforts.
Home service lines may not be the largest contributor of lead Despite the huge media attention focused on the service lines, one of the major takeaways from our analyses is that these service lines may not be the major driver of the lead in Flint’s drinking water. Yes, it is the case that those homes with copper service lines have lower lead levels, on average, than those with lead in their service line. But when you look closely at the water testing data, the differences are much smaller than you might think.
While it is difficult to determine with certainty due to the spotty records, what we have found is that large spikes of lead occur in homes with and without lead service lines. This suggests a large fraction of the dangerously high lead readings are probably not being driven by the service line material but instead by other factors. Civil engineers who study these problems report that lead can leach from several sources, including the home’s interior plumbing, faucet fixtures and aging pipe solder.
We can look at homes that, based on records and home inspections, appear to have copper-only service lines versus those containing some lead. We plot the distribution of the lead readings for water samples from these two home categories. The Conversation US
What we can conclude is that citizens as well as policymakers may need to widen their focus beyond the service line materials and consider alternative efforts to address other sources of lead. Service line replacement is certainly a necessary part of the solution, but it will not be sufficient.
Toward solving the broader problem, data and statistical tools can help greatly reduce risks at much lower cost, and a data-oriented understanding of the problems in Flint can guide efforts to address lead concerns in other regions as well.

Arizona Football Welcomes Grambling State and The GSU Tiger Marching Band By Peggy McClain/FanSided via Zona Zealots Sep 8, 2016 at 3:23p ET 0Shares 
This Saturday at the Arizona Football Stadium the opponent’s marching band will play at halftime, an occasion which normally only occurs when Arizona State or Northern Arizona compete against the Wildcat football team. 
This won’t be the first time the Grambling State Band has taken the field with The Pride of Arizona. On January 15, 1967, during the very first Super Bowl’s halftime show, GSU ’s 129-member all male band played along with the University of Arizona’s band. The next 23 Super Bowls featured college marching bands, before the era of big-name artists graced the Super Bowl stage. 
You have the watch this video to the end to catch their moves (and the Nae Nae): Yes, Grambling St. will be bringing their band ????​. https://t.co/L3nk02439J https://t.co/7e5odcbvGe

GSU went on to march in four more Super Bowl halftimes, have played in commercials and inspired the 2002 film ‘Drumline.’ The Tiger Band got its start in 1926 when a new faculty member, Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones, struck an instrument deal with Sears and Roebuck. More from Zona Zealots Arizona vs. BYU: Biggest plays, Who shined, What needs improvement 3d ago 
Seventeen instruments were secured, and the band was born. Later, Mr. Jones became Grambling’s President and held that position for 50 years. The band’s connections to Presidents didn’t stop there; they played in the inaugural parade of President George W. Bush and both of President Obama’s inaugurations. 
Coincidentally, the University of Arizona marching band, The Pride of Arizona, was invited to play at President Carter’s inauguration. The Pride started way back in 1902 as the UA ROTC band with only twelve members. Currently, there are 250 Pride members, including the musicians, twirlers, pom and flag lines. 
As recently as 2013, the Pride had a brush with a commercial endeavor. They used Arizona Stadium to record the Bay City Rollers hit “Saturday Night” for a nationwide Hyundai commercial. 
Grambling State is known nationwide for its well-traveled, innovative and energetic band. Just a year ago, they traveled to Berkeley to perform at the Golden Bear’s game. 
This year The Pride of Arizona welcomes University of Arizona and band alum, Professor Chad Shoopman as the marching band’s new permanent director. Shout out to Tucson News Now for this excellent feature. Welcome home, professor Shoopman! https://t.co/RaA9fmlXYA

Both Grambling State’s and Arizona’s band members feature hard-working college kids. Like the football teams, they arrive on campus in late summer, well before classes begin to start practicing, so they are ready for opening day. The band members won’t get drafted in the NFL and marching at halftime won’t bring them fame and fortune. However, It has been proven that those who played music in school are more successful in their careers. These students stay until the end of each game, no matter the score or the weather, and during the week they balance their classes with additional practices.

This Saturday let’s give both the Tiger Marching Band and the Pride of Arizona our full support and attention. Thanks for coming to the desert Grambling State. As for Arizona, BearDown and beat the Tigers! Stay all 60 minutes, or you might miss a great play, or a great song.

Posted on,9/8/2016 19:29,"A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

the LGG,9/8/2016 19:30,"The Ames Tribune is reporting a rather unexpected development regarding Big 12 expansion. The Iowa State Student Senate has passed a resolution in opposition to the inclusion of BYU to the Big 12 conference,
Stating that it “believes that BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12 Conference,""and that it ""does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big 12 conference at this time.”
BYU is thought to be the front-runner of potential new members, but several groups have taken issue with the school's honor code and their stance on sexual orientation.
The Cougar's honor code does not prevent any LGBT student from attending, but makes it clear that homosexual behavior is not accepted by the school.
Current Big 12 member Baylor, also a private, religious school, used to have a similar policy, but removed it in 2015.
Twenty-five different groups wrote letters to the Big 12 office last month in opposition to the BYU's inclusion into the conference, and as expansion candidate interviews take place in Dallas this week, it looks like the Big 12 office will receive one more. This time, from an organization within the conference.
“Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed. The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.”

We contact coaches from all 351 Division I schools for the data you find below, and any player moving on to a program at any level of college basketball is eligible for inclusion in the list.
This year we've broken the list up into categories to make things more easily digestible, beginning with a top-five available transfers group that will be updated as names come off the board.

HOUSTON — Almost as soon as the Big 12 announced this summer that it was open to expanding to 12 teams, from the conference’s current stable of 10, nearly two dozen universities clambered forward like shoppers outside a Walmart on the day after Thanksgiving.
It is a diverse group — Brigham Young and Boise State, Temple and Tulane, Cincinnati and Connecticut — but at the front of the line, to the chagrin of some, stands the University of Houston .
Left behind 20 years ago when several of its rivals in the defunct Southwest Conference teamed with the old Big Eight to form the Big 12, Houston, whose sixth-ranked football team is the best one in the second-tier Group of 5 conferences, presents itself as a geographic, historic and just plain logical fit for the Big 12, which already sends almost half of its mail to Texas addresses.

Last Saturday, the Cougars had something their rivals for Big 12 favor could not match: a captive audience for a visit by the conference’s defending champion, Oklahoma, on the opening weekend of the college football season. Following around university officials on the field and as they dropped in and out of the suites on NRG Stadium’s luxury level offered a glimpse into the uniquely Lone Star State blend of power, politics and football that Houston can bring to bear in its quest to graduate to the big time.
Membership in a Power 5 conference — and the attendant media rights revenue that it brings — is a golden ticket in college sports. Last fiscal year, for instance, while the Cougars took in about $3 million in media rights payments as a member of the American Athletic Conference, Iowa State’s membership in the Big 12 was worth 10 times that — about $30 million — even as the Cyclones won 10 fewer games than the Cougars, who were 13-1.

Houston’s athletic director, Hunter Yurachek, acknowledged that that kind of success, in a season that concluded with a win over Florida State in the Peach Bowl, could be fleeting.
'Can we sustain that at the conference we’re currently in?' Yurachek said. 'No. Absolutely not.'

Without the perks of Power 5 membership — the millions of dollars from media contracts and the additional revenue in ticket sales, sponsorships and donations that annual games against the Sooners and state rivals like Texas, Baylor, Texas Tech and Texas Christian could gin up — a program like Houston’s will have a tougher time appealing to top recruits. It will also struggle to retain coaching talents like its second-year head coach, Tom Herman, something the Cougars learned recently as two of his predecessors, Art Briles and Kevin Sumlin, departed for Baylor and Texas A&M.

C.R. Berry,9/8/2016 19:34,"9/11 was deadliest terrorist atrocity the world ever saw, but not everyone agrees on who the terrorists were that day. Many still believe that the US government, not al-Qaeda, were responsible for the attack. That the planes that collided with the Twin Towers were just a smokescreen for a controlled demolition of both buildings....
There’s enough material on 9/11 conspiracy theories to fill a library. Last year I wrote a blog about a particularly bizarre theory, namely that on September 11th 2001, no planes crashed. Yes, I saw you roll your eyes. This week I’m looking at something slightly more down-to-earth. Could this one hold any truth?
At 8.46am—exactly 15 years ago this Sunday—American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Centre in New York City. At 9.03am, United Airlines Flight 175 crashed into the South Tower. At 9.59am, the South Tower completely collapsed, followed by the North Tower at 10.28am. For those of us watching—in the thick of it in New York or at home on TV—it made sense. Horrible, appalling sense. If you crash a jumbo get into a skyscraper, there’s a high chance it’s going to collapse.
Except that architect Richard Gage, physicist Steven E. Jones and a bunch of others disagree. They argue that the aircraft impacts and resulting fires couldn’t have weakened the buildings enough to cause them to collapse so catastrophically. They contend that neither building would have collapsed completely or at such high speeds.
Instead they argue that both buildings were rigged with explosives as part of a conspiracy inside the Bush administration. It was all an elaborate means of justifying the subsequent invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq to advance US oil interests.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paOfROQ00a0
The case for demolition
A number of eyewitnesses reported seeing or hearing explosions before the Twin Towers collapsed. Neil deGrasse Tyson, watching the horror from his apartment six blocks away, recalled:
“I hear a second explosion in WTC 2, then a loud, low-frequency rumble that precipitates the unthinkable—a collapse of all the floors above the point of explosion.”
And Louie Cacchioli, one of the first firefighters to enter the South Tower as it was burning, recalled:
“I was taking firefighters up in the elevator to the 24th floor to get in position to evacuate workers. On the last trip up a bomb went off. We think there were bombs set in the building.”
Sudden puffs of smoke that looked like explosions inside the buildings were witnessed and captured on film, as in the following clip:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I_NXk-Iqjk
Molten metal was also seen pouring out of the sides of the South Tower prior to its collapse. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which investigated the collapse of the towers, documented this and concluded that it was molten aluminium from the planes.
But Steven E. Jones pointed out that molten aluminium would not have glowed orange like the metal pouring out of the South Tower. It should have been silvery-white. NIST argued that it was orange because it was mixed in with a bunch of combustible materials like furniture and computers from inside the building. However, Jones tested this hypothesis and proved NIST wrong—the combustible materials would not have ‘mixed in’ or produced an orange glow like the one observed.
Plus, NIST’s hypothesis was just that. It was an untested theory. They hadn’t properly investigated the molten metal pouring out of the building.
Steven E. Jones believes that the molten metal was in fact elemental iron, produced by a nano-thermite reaction, and that a number of carefully set nano-thermite explosions brought the towers down. He and his researchers analysed samples of dust from the WTC wreckage and found evidence of nano-thermite material. NIST responded saying that the evidence was not clear that Jones’s dust had come from the WTC site, but when Jones invited NIST to test their own samples, NIST failed to do so.
The case against demolition
NIST “found no corroborating evidence for alternative hypotheses suggesting that the WTC towers were brought down by controlled demolition using explosives planted prior to Sept. 11, 2001”. And the structural engineering community rejects the claims of conspiracy theorists, saying that the aircraft impacts and ensuing fires alone are responsible for the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This includes Brigham Young University, where Steven E. Jones worked. They basically hung him out to dry, putting him on paid leave and issuing a statement saying that the structural engineering faculty “do not support the hypotheses of Professor Jones”.
Regarding the loud noises, flashes and puffs of smoke seen and heard by eyewitnesses, it’s believed that they could have been a multitude of things—not necessarily explosions. Seismographic records do not show any evidence of explosions. And NIST attributed the puffs of smoke to bursts of high-pressure air forcing smoke and debris out of the windows, or to walls and portions of floor collapsing.
Chemist Frank Greening and metallurgist Christian Simensen aren’t entirely convinced by this, and do not believe NIST has answered every question about the collapse and the explosions satisfactorily. Instead, they argue that the melted aluminium from the planes might’ve come into contact with the buildings' sprinkler systems. They argue that molten aluminium is highly explosive when mixed with water, and that coming into contact with the sprinklers could have set off a sequence of explosions that brought the towers down.
But, while there do seem to be holes in the NIST report and things they could and should have investigated, controlled demolition theory is far-fetched. Actually, that’s an understatement. You’d have to believe that thousands of pounds of explosives were sneaked past security and hidden in both towers without any of the tens of thousands of people working in the WTC noticing!
Psychology professor Stuart Vyse sums up my thoughts on this crock of nonsense nicely:
“How many hundreds of people would you need to acquire the explosives, plant them in the buildings, arrange for the airplanes to crash and, perhaps most implausibly of all, never breathe a single word of this conspiracy?”

(CNN) A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians at the time. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
The reference to the woman's faith is what makes this translation significant, Blumell said.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""

""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.

Comments 
BYU associate professor of ancient scripture Lincoln H. Blumell recently translated a 1,700-year-old inscription written in ancient Greek on an epitaph from Egypt. 
The small limestone epitaph, which is just slightly larger than the size of an iPad, was discovered in a collection of Greek and Coptic artifacts in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah’s J. Willard Marriott Library, where it sat since its donation in 1989. 
The inscription commemorates a woman named Helene. She is identified as a Jew, but is also referenced with a title reserved almost exclusively at the time for a Christian. This is a rare occurrence, especially considering the time period when this was composed. The inscription also memorializes Helene’s care and love for orphans. 
Here is the entire translation of the inscription: In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered. 
Here it is as it appears in Greek: ἐν εἰρήνῃ καὶ εὐλογίᾳἌμα Ἑλένη Ἰουδαία ἣ ἀ̣-γαποῦσα τοὺς ὀρφανούς·ὡς ἐτῶν ξ̅ ἔλεως καὶ εὐ-λογία〈ς〉ἡ ὁδὸς· ἡ εὐπορευ-θῇ ἐν αὐτῇ. 
“I’ve looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs,” Blumell said, “and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman.” 
While Helene is identified as Ἰουδαία (a Jew), she is also referred to as Ἄμα (Ama), a title that is used only for nuns and other certain Christian women in late antique Egypt. 
This inscription also helps to identify the Jewish community in Egypt in the period after the deadly Jewish revolt of A.D. 115–117 when the Jewish community was decimated. It is estimated that this was written some time in the A.D. 200s. 
When the Marriott Library received the epitaph as a gift from Aziz S. Atiya in 1989 it was identified as a ""Coptic inscription, dating from the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third."" 
“That is how we described it for the next twenty-seven years, and we were wrong” said Luise Poulton, managing curator of rare books at the library. “Professor Blumell's work on this piece, then, is as satisfying as it is fascinating. Dr. Blumell not only brought fact to surmisal regarding the piece, he has given us a very personal story to put to cold stone.” 
Considering the unique use of dual-faith identifiers and the timeframe alone, the epitaph is unique with no known parallels. 
Additionally, Blumell notes there is even more to the inscription. Scholars have noted from other inscriptions that Egyptian women during this timeframe had a life expectancy of 25 years. To live 60 years, as noted in the inscription, was incredible. Also, during a time when any sort of social programs were unavailable to orphans, taking care of them was seen as a very noble pursuit. Serving the widows and orphans is a common call to action in the New Testament. 
“Dr. Blumell brought his own expertise and that of other faculty at BYU to identify an example of third-century philanthropy and charity,” Poulton said, “qualities we ask of ourselves and each other in a society and culture very different from Helene's. This ancient inscription now testifies to good works and ‘faith working through love,’ as expressed by Paul in Galatians, then and now.”

United States History I INTRODUCTION United States History , story of how the republic developed from colonial beginnings in the 16th century, when the first European explorers arrived, until modern times. As the nation developed, it expanded westward from small settlements along the Atlantic Coast, eventually including all the territory between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans across the middle of the North American continent, as well as two noncontiguous states and a number of territories. At the same time, the population and the economy of the United States grew and changed dramatically. The population diversified as immigrants arrived from all countries of the world. From its beginnings as a remote English colony, the United States has developed the largest economy in the world. Throughout its history, the United States has faced struggles, both within the country—between various ethnic, religious, political, and economic groups—and with other nations. The efforts to deal with and resolve these struggles have shaped the United States of America into the 21st century. This is one of seven major articles that together provide a comprehensive discussion of the United States of America. For more information on the United States, please see the other six major articles: United States (Overview), United States (Geography), United States (People), United States (Culture), United States (Economy), and United States (Government). 
II EARLY CULTURAL INTERACTION   Early American history began in the collision of European, West African, and Native American peoples in North America. Europeans “discovered” America by accident, then created empires out of the conquest of indigenous peoples and the enslavement of Africans. Yet conquest and enslavement were accompanied by centuries of cultural interaction—interaction that spelled disaster for Africans and Native Americans and triumph for Europeans, to be sure, but interaction that transformed all three peoples in the process. A Native America in 1580 The lands and human societies that European explorers called a New World were in fact very old. During the Ice Ages much of the world’s water was bound up in glaciers. Sea level dropped by hundreds of feet, creating a land bridge between Alaska and Siberia. Asians walked across to become the first human inhabitants of the Americas. Precisely when this happened remains unknown, but most scientists believe it occured before 15,000 years ago. When the last glaciers receded about 10,000 years ago (thus ending this first great migration to America), ancestors of the Native Americans filled nearly all of the habitable parts of North and South America. They lived in isolation from the history—and particularly from the diseases—of what became known as the Old World. See also First Americans. The Native Americans who greeted the first Europeans had become diverse peoples. They spoke between 300 and 350 distinct languages, and their societies and ways of living varied tremendously. The Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru built great empires ( see Aztec Empire; Inca Empire). In what is now the United States, the Mississippians ( see Mound Builders) built cities surrounded by farmland between present–day St. Louis, Missouri, (where their city of Cahokia was larger than medieval London) and Natchez, Mississippi. The Mississippians’ “Great Sun” king ruled authoritatively and was carried from place to place by servants, preceded by flute–players. The Pueblo peoples of the Southwest lived in large towns, irrigated their dry land with river water, and traded with peoples as far away as Mexico and California. In the East, the peoples who eventually encountered English settlers were varied, but they lived in similar ways. All of them grew much of their food. Women farmed and gathered food in the woods. Men hunted, fished, and made war. None of these peoples kept herds of domestic animals; they relied on abundant wild game for protein. All lived in family groups, but owed their principal loyalties to a wider network of kin and to their clans. Some—the Iroquois in upstate New York and the Powhatan confederacy in Virginia—formed alliances called confederacies for the purposes of keeping peace among neighbors and making war on outsiders. Even within these confederacies, however, everyday political organization seldom extended beyond villages, and village chiefs ruled their independent–minded people by consent. B West Africa in 1580 In Central and West Africa, the great inland kingdoms of Mali and Ghana were influenced (and largely converted) by Islam, and these kingdoms had traded with the Muslim world for hundreds of years. From the beginning, slaves were among the articles of trade. These earliest enslaved Africans were criminals, war captives, and people sold by their relatives to settle debts. New World demand increased the slave trade and changed it. Some of the coastal kingdoms of present–day Togo and Benin entered the trade as middlemen. They conducted raids into the interior and sold their captives to European slavers. Nearly all of the Africans enslaved and brought to America by this trade were natives of the western coastal rain forests and the inland forests of the Congo and Central Africa. About half of all Africans who were captured, enslaved, and sent to the Americas were Bantu–speaking peoples. Others were from smaller ethnic and language groups. Most had been farmers in their homeland. The men hunted, fished, and tended animals, while women and men worked the fields cooperatively and in large groups. They lived in kin–based villages that were parts of small kingdoms. They practiced polygyny (men often had several wives, each of whom maintained a separate household), and their societies tended to give very specific spiritual duties to women and men. Adolescent girls and boys were inducted into secret societies in which they learned the sacred and separate duties of women and men. These secret societies provided supernatural help from the spirits that governed tasks such as hunting, farming, fertility, and childbirth. Although formal political leaders were all men, older, privileged women exercised great power over other women. Thus enslaved African peoples in the New World came from societies in which women raised children and governed one another, and where men and women were more nearly equal than in America or Europe. C European Exploration In the century before Columbus sailed to America, Western Europeans were unlikely candidates for worldwide exploration. The Chinese possessed the wealth and the seafaring skills that would have enabled them to explore, but they had little interest in the world outside of China. The Arabs and other Islamic peoples also possessed wealth and skills. But they expanded into territories that were next to them—and not across uncharted oceans. The Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople in 1453 and by the 1520s had nearly reached Vienna. These conquests gave them control over the overland trade routes to Asia as well as the sea route through the Persian Gulf. The conquests also gave them an expanding empire to occupy their attention. Western Europeans, on the other hand, were developing the necessary wealth and technology and a compelling need to explore. A group of new monarchs were making nation-states in Britain and in continental Europe—states with unprecedentedly large treasuries and military establishments. The population of Western European nations was growing, providing a tax base and a labor force for new classes of large landholders. These “elites” provided markets for goods that were available only through trade with Asia. When the expansion of Islam gave control of eastern trade routes to Islamic middlemen, Western Europeans had strong incentives to find other ways to get to Asia. They were also developing sailing technology and knowledge of currents and winds to travel long distances on the open sea. The Portuguese led the way. They copied and improved upon the designs of Arab sailing ships and learned to mount cannons on those ships. In the 15th century they began exploring the west coast of Africa—bypassing Arab merchants to trade directly for African gold and slaves. They also colonized the Madeira Islands, the Azores, and the Cape Verde Islands and turned them into the first European slave plantations. The European explorers were all looking for an ocean route to Asia. Christopher Columbus sailed for the monarchs of Spain in 1492. He used the familiar prevailing winds to the Canary Islands, off the northwest coast of Africa, and then sailed on. In about two months he landed in the Caribbean on an island in the Bahamas, thinking he had reached the East Indies. Columbus made three more voyages. He died in 1506, still believing that he had discovered a water route to Asia. The Spanish investigated further. Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci sailed to the northern coast of South America in 1499 and pronounced the land a new continent. European mapmakers named it America in his honor. Spanish explorer Vasco Núñez de Balboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama and in 1513 became the first of the European explorers of America to see the Pacific Ocean. That same year another Spaniard, Juan Ponce de León, explored the Bahamas and Florida in search of the fountain of youth. The first European voyages to the northern coast of America were old and forgotten: The Norsemen (Scandinavian Vikings) sailed from Greenland and stayed in Newfoundland for a time around 1000. Some scholars argue that European fishermen had discovered the fishing waters off eastern Canada by 1480. But the first recorded voyage was made by John Cabot, an Italian navigator in the service of England, who sailed from England to Newfoundland in 1497. Giovanni da Verrazzano, in 1524, and Jacques Cartier, in 1534, explored nearly the whole Atlantic coast of the present United States for France. By that time, Europeans had scouted the American coast from Newfoundland to Brazil. While they continued to look for shortcuts to Asia, Europeans began to think of America for its own sake. Spain again led the way: Hernán Cortés invaded Mexico in 1519, and Francisco Pizarro did the same in Peru in 1532. D Cultural Interaction: The Columbian Exchange What was to become American history began in a biological and cultural collision of Europeans, Native Americans, and Africans. Europeans initiated this contact and often dictated its terms. For Native Americans and Africans, American history began in disaster. Native Americans suffered heavily because of their isolation from the rest of the world. Europe, Africa, and Asia had been trading knowledge and technologies for centuries. Societies on all three continents had learned to use iron and kept herds of domestic animals. Europeans had acquired gunpowder, paper, and navigational equipment from the Chinese. Native Americans, on the other hand, had none of these. They were often helpless against European conquerors with horses, firearms, and—especially—armor and weapons. The most disastrous consequence of the long-term isolation of the Americas was biological. Asians, Africans, and Europeans had been exposed to one another’s diseases for millennia; by 1500 they had developed an Old World immune system that partially protected them from most diseases. On average, Native Americans were bigger and healthier than the Europeans who first encountered them. But they were helpless against European and African diseases. Smallpox was the biggest killer, but illnesses such as measles and influenza also killed millions of people. The indigenous population of Mexico, for example, was more than 17 million when Cortés landed in 1519. By 1630 it had dropped to 750,000, largely as a result of disease. Scholars estimate that on average the population of a Native American people dropped 90 percent in the first century of contact. The worst wave of epidemics in human history cleared the way for European conquest. See also United States (People): Disease and Death in Early America . Europeans used the new lands as sources of precious metals and plantation agriculture. Both were complex operations that required labor in large, closely supervised groups. Attempts to enslave indigenous peoples failed, and attempts to force them into other forms of bound labor were slightly more successful but also failed because workers died of disease. Europeans turned to the African slave trade as a source of labor for the Americas. During the colonial periods of North and South America and the Caribbean, far more Africans than Europeans came to the New World. The slave trade brought wealth to some Europeans and some Africans, but the growth of the slave trade disrupted African political systems, turned slave raiding into full–scale war, and robbed many African societies of their young men. The European success story in the Americas was achieved at horrendous expense for the millions of Native Americans who died and for the millions of Africans who were enslaved. 
III COLONIAL EXPERIMENTS Beginning in 1519, Spain, Portugal, France, The Netherlands, and England established colonies in the Americas. Spain made a great mining and agricultural empire in Mexico, South America, and the Caribbean. Portugal created a slave-based agricultural colony in Brazil. In North America the French and Dutch established rudimentary European societies and, more importantly, elaborate, long-term trading networks with the indigenous peoples. Among the European invaders of North America, only the English established colonies of agricultural settlers, whose interests in Native Americans was less about trade than about the acquisition of land. That fact would have huge implications in the long struggle for control of North America. A New Spain Spain was the first European nation to colonize America. Cortés invaded Mexico and (with the help of smallpox and other Native Americans) defeated the Aztec Empire between 1519 and 1521. By 1533 Pizarro had conquered the Incas of Peru. Both civilizations possessed artifacts made of precious metals, and the Spanish searched for rumored piles of gold and silver. They sent expeditions under Hernando de Soto, Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, and Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca as far north as what is now Kansas and Colorado. They were looking for cities made of gold and did not find them. But in 1545 they did discover silver at Potosí, in what is now Bolivia, and in Mexico around the same time. New World gold and silver mines were the base of Spanish wealth and power for the next hundred years. Shortly after the conquests, Catholic missionaries—Jesuits until 1571, Franciscans and Dominicans after that—attempted to convert Native Americans to Christianity. They established missions not only at the centers of the new empire but also in New Mexico and Florida. Spanish Jesuits even built a short–lived mission outpost in Virginia. After defeating indigenous peoples, Spanish conquerors established a system of forced labor called encomienda . However, Spanish governmental and religious officials disliked the brutality of this system. As time passed, Spanish settlers claimed land rather than labor, establishing large estates called haciendas . By the time French, Dutch, Swedish, and English colonists began arriving in the New World in the early 17th century, the Spanish colonies in New Spain (Mexico), New Granada (Colombia), and the Caribbean were nearly 100 years old. The colonies were a source of power for Spain, and a source of jealousy from other European nations. B New France By the 1530s French explorers had scouted the coast of America from Newfoundland to the Carolinas. Samuel de Champlain built the foundations of what would become French Canada (New France). From 1604 to 1606 he established a settlement at Acadia in Nova Scotia, and in 1608 he traveled up the St. Lawrence River, made contact with the Huron and Algonquin peoples, and established a French settlement at Québec. From the beginning, New France concentrated on two activities: fur trade and Catholic missions. Missionaries and traders were often at odds, but both knew that the success of New France depended upon friendly relations with the native peoples. While Jesuits converted thousands of Native Americans, French traders roamed the forests. Both were among the first white explorers of the interior of North America, and France’s ties with Native Americans would have important implications for the next 150 years. By 1700 the French population of New France was 14,000. French Canada was a strategically crucial brake on English settlement. But the much smaller sugar islands in the Caribbean—Saint-Domingue (Haiti), Guadeloupe, and Martinique—were economically far more valuable to France. C Dutch Settlements Another contender for influence in North America was the Dutch, inhabitants of the leading commercial nation in the early 17th century. Sailing for the Dutch in 1609, Henry Hudson explored the river that now bears his name. The Dutch established a string of agricultural settlements between New Amsterdam (New York City) and Fort Orange (Albany, New York) after 1614. They became the chief European traders with the Iroquois, supplying them with firearms, blankets, metal tools, and other European trade goods in exchange for furs. The Iroquois used those goods to nearly destroy the Huron and to push the Algonquins into Illinois and Michigan. As a result, the Iroquois gained control of the Native American side of the fur trade. The Dutch settlements, known as New Netherland, grew slowly at first and became more urban as trade with the indigenous peoples outdistanced agriculture as a source of income. The colony was prosperous and tolerated different religions. As a result, it attracted a steady and diverse stream of European immigrants. In the 1640s the 450 inhabitants of New Amsterdam spoke 18 different languages. The colony had grown to a European population of 6,000 (double that of New France) on the eve of its takeover by England in 1664. D First English Settlements The Spanish, French, and Dutch wanted to find precious metals in the Americas, to trade with the indigenous peoples, and to convert them to Christianity. Their agricultural colonies in the Caribbean, Mexico, and South America were worked by African slaves and by unwilling native peoples, and relatively few Europeans settled permanently in those places. In contrast, England, a latecomer to New World colonization, sent more people to the Americas than other European nations—about 400,000 in the 17th century—and established more permanent agricultural colonies. English migrants came to America for two main reasons. The first reason was tied to the English Reformation. King Henry VIII broke with the Catholic Church in the 1530s. Through a series of political and religious twists and turns, the new Church of England developed a Protestant theology, but it retained much of Catholic liturgy and ritual forms. Within the Church of England, radical Protestants, later called Puritans, wanted to suppress the remaining Catholic forms. The fortunes of the Puritans depended on the religious preferences of English monarchs. Queen Mary I, who ruled from 1553 to 1558, was a committed Catholic who tried to roll back the tide of religious change; she executed hundreds of Protestants and chased many more into exile. Her successor, Elizabeth I, invited the exiles back and tried to resolve differences within the English church. The Stuart kings who followed her, James I and Charles I, again persecuted Puritans. As a result, Puritans became willing to immigrate to America. The second reason for English colonization was that land in England had become scarce. The population of England doubled from 1530 to 1680. In the same years, many of England’s largest landholders evicted tenants from their lands, fenced the lands, and raised sheep for the expanding wool trade. The result was a growing number of young, poor, underemployed, and often desperate English men and women. It was from their ranks that colonizers recruited most of the English population of the mainland colonies. 
IV GROWTH OF THE ENGLISH COLONIES Permanent English settlement began in the Chesapeake Bay area in 1607 and in Massachusetts in 1620. The histories of the two regions during their first century and a half are almost opposite. Virginia began as a misguided business venture and as a disorderly society of young men. Massachusetts settlers were Puritans. They arrived as whole families and sometimes as whole congregations, and they lived by laws derived from the Old Testament. Over time, however, Virginia was transformed into a slave-based tobacco colony where slaves were carefully disciplined, where most white families owned land, and where a wealthy and stable planter-slaveholder class provided much of the leadership of revolutionary and early national America. New England, on the other hand, evolved into a more secularized and increasingly overpopulated society based on family farms and inherited land—land that was becoming scarce to the point that increasing numbers of whites were slipping into poverty. A The Chesapeake A 1 Virginia Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement in America, began as a business venture that failed. The Virginia Company of London, a joint stock company organized much like a modern corporation, sent 104 colonists to Chesapeake Bay in 1607. The company wanted to repeat the successes of the Spanish: The colonists were to look for gold and silver, for a passage to Asia, and for other discoveries that would quickly reward investors. If the work was heavy, the colonists were to force indigenous peoples to help them. The composition of the group sent to Jamestown reflected the company’s expectations for life in the colony. Colonists included silversmiths, goldsmiths, even a perfumer, and far too many gentlemen who were unprepared for rugged colonial life. The colonists found a defensible spot on low ground and named it Jamestown. None of their plans worked out, and the settlers began to die of dysentery and typhoid fever. At the end of the first year, only about one-third remained alive. The Native Americans were troublesome, too. Organized into the large and powerful Powhatan confederacy, they grew tired of demands for food and launched a war against the settlers that continued intermittently from 1609 to 1614. In 1619 the Virginia Company reorganized. The colony gave up the search for quick profits and turned to growing tobacco. Under the new plan, colonists received 50 acres from the company for paying a person’s passage to Virginia. The new settlers were indentured servants who agreed to work off the price of their passage. Thus settlers who could afford it received land and labor at the same time. In 1624 King James I of England made Virginia the first royal colony. He revoked the Virginia Company’s charter and appointed a royal governor and council, and established a House of Burgesses elected by the settlers. Despite fights with the Powhatan confederacy (about 350 settlers died in one attack in 1622), the Virginia colony began to prosper. It had found a cash crop, a source of labor, and a stable government. A 2 Maryland In 1634 Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, founded Maryland under a royal charter, which made the colony Baltimore’s personal property. Baltimore, a Catholic nobleman, hoped to establish a refuge for English Catholics and sell large estates to individuals who would operate as feudal lords. Neither the plans for feudalism nor for a Catholic refuge worked out, however. More Protestants than Catholics immigrated to Maryland. In 1649 Baltimore granted religious toleration to all Christians, but Protestants did not stop opposing him. They even overthrew Baltimore’s government on several occasions. Baltimore’s dreams of feudalism failed as well. Freed servants preferred farming on their own to staying on as tenants, and the colony quickly evolved as Virginia had: Planters (many of them former servants) imported servants from England and grew tobacco. A 3 Mortality Rate Chesapeake tobacco growers needed able–bodied servants. Most of those imported to Virginia and Maryland were young, poor, single men. Disease, bad water, and hostile native peoples produced a horrific death rate. In 1618 there were 700 English settlers in Virginia. The reorganized Virginia Company sent 3,000 more before 1622. A headcount that year found only about 1,200 still alive. Still, surviving planters continued to import servants. Some servants lived long enough to end their indentures, but many others died. In addition, there were too few women in the Chesapeake to enable surviving men to build families and produce new Virginians. More than two-thirds of men never married, and the white population of Virginia did not begin to sustain itself until at least the 1680s. Before that, the colony survived only by importing new people to replace those who died. A 4 Introduction of Slavery White servants worked Chesapeake tobacco farms until the late 17th century. But earlier in the century, English tobacco and sugar planters in the Caribbean had adopted African slavery, long the chief labor system in Portuguese and Spanish sugar colonies in the Caribbean. By 1700 the English islands were characterized by large plantations and by populations that were overwhelmingly African. These African slaves were victims of a particularly brutal and unhealthy plantation system that killed most of them. It was not a coincidence that these islands produced more wealth for England than its other colonies. See also Slavery in the United States: Introduction of Slavery . Before the 1680s, Chesapeake planters purchased few African slaves, and the status of Africans in Virginia and Maryland was unclear. Some were slaves, some were servants, some were free, and no legal code defined their standing. The reasons for the slow growth of slavery in the Chesapeake were not moral but economic. First, slave traders received high prices for slaves in the Caribbean—higher than Virginians could afford, particularly when these expensive laborers were likely to die. White indentured servants cost less, and planters lost little when they died. But Chesapeake colonists—both English and African—grew healthier as they became “seasoned” on their new continent. At the same time, the English economic crisis that had supplied servants to the colonies diminished. These changes made African slaves a better long–term investment: The initial cost was higher, but the slaves lived and reproduced. Beginning around 1675, Virginia and Maryland began importing large numbers of African slaves. By 1690 black slaves outnumbered white servants in those colonies. Virginia now gave white servants who survived their indentures 50 acres of land, thus making them a part of the white landholding class. At the same time, the House of Burgesses drew up legal codes that assumed a lifetime of bondage for blacks. In the early 18th century, the Chesapeake emerged as a society of planters and small farmers who grew tobacco with the labor of African slaves. There had been slaves in Virginia since 1619. But it was not until nearly 100 years later that Virginia became a slave society. B The Beginnings of New England New England began as a refuge for religious radicals. The first English settlers were the Pilgrims. They were Separatists—Protestants who, unlike the Puritans, seceded from the Church of England rather than try to reform it. They sailed for the New World in 1620. After difficult early years, they established a community of farms at Plymouth that was ultimately absorbed by the Massachusetts Bay Company. B 1 Religion in the New England Colonies A much larger Puritan migration began in 1630. The Puritans objected to the corruption and extravagance of the Stuart kings, who considered alliances with Catholic monarchs and paid no attention to Puritan demands for religious reform. The Puritans came to believe that God would destroy England for these sins. They obtained a charter from the Massachusetts Bay Company and made plans to emigrate—not to hide in the wilderness from God’s wrath, but to preserve Protestant beliefs and to act as a beacon of truth for the world. A thousand Puritans migrated to Massachusetts in 1630. But this Great Migration ended in 1642, when the Puritans became involved in a civil war against the Stuart kings. The Puritans eventually won and ruled England until 1660. When the migration ended, Massachusetts had 13,000 European inhabitants. The Puritans left England because of religious persecution, but they, too, were intolerant. In Massachusetts they established laws derived from the Bible, and they punished or expelled those who did not share their beliefs. The Puritans established a governor and a general court (an assembly elected by adult male church members) and governed themselves. Although they refused to secede from the Church of England, they did away with bishops and church hierarchy and invented congregationalism. In this type of Protestantism, each congregation selected its own minister and governed its own religious life (although outside authority sometimes intervened to punish heresy). Government officials were expected to enforce godly authority, which often meant punishing religious heresy. Roger Williams was a Separatist who refused to worship with anyone who, like nearly all Puritans, remained part of the Church of England. Massachusetts banished him, and he and a few followers founded Providence in what is now Rhode Island. Anne Hutchinson was a merchant’s wife and a devout Puritan, but she claimed that she received messages directly from God and was beyond earthly authority. This belief was a heresy , a belief contrary to church teachings, known as Antinomianism. She, too, was banished and she moved to Rhode Island. Puritan magistrates continued to enforce religious laws: In the 1650s they persecuted Quakers, and in the 1690s they executed people accused of witchcraft. B 2 Growth of New England’s Population Once the Puritan migration to New England stopped in 1642, the region would receive few immigrants for the next 200 years. Yet the population grew dramatically, to nearly 120,000 in 1700. Two reasons explain this. First, in sharp contrast to the unhealthy Chesapeake, Massachusetts streams provided relatively safe drinking water, and New England’s cold winters kept dangerous microbes to a minimum. Thus disease and early death were not the problems that they were farther south. Second (again in contrast to the Chesapeake) the Puritans migrated in families, and there were about two women for every three men, even in the early years. Nearly all colonists married (typically in their mid–20s for men and early 20s for women), and then produced children at two-year intervals. With both a higher birth rate and a longer life expectancy than in England, the Puritan population grew rapidly almost from the beginning. C The Restoration Colonies By 1640 England had founded 6 of the 13 colonies that would become the original United States. In 1660, after the end of Puritan rule, Charles II was crowned king of England, an event known as the Restoration. Charles founded or took over six more colonies: New York (taken from the Dutch in 1664), New Jersey, Pennsylvania (including what became Delaware), and North and South Carolina. All were proprietary colonies—huge land grants to individuals or small groups who had been loyal to the king during the civil war. These colonies shared other similarities as well. None of them was well–funded; they could ill afford to import colonists from overseas. Thus they tried to attract settlers from other colonies as much as from the Old World. These colonies made it easy to own land, and they tended to grant religious toleration to al",,http://www.boroface.com/2016/09/united-states-history-i-introduction.html,en,FALSE,0,0,RSS,Negative,,US,,,,,,,,,,0,0

KLIK-AM,9/8/2016 20:03,"Is this 1,700-year-old tablet the world's oldest obituary?
(CNN) A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians at the time. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
The reference to the woman's faith is what makes this translation significant, Blumell said.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""

(CNN) - A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late ancient Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

I think itâs huge for both those two programs to try to, if they can, keep as much talent at home. —Scout.com national recruiting analyst Greg Biggins 
While the University of Utah and BYU football teams are preparing this week to face one another in Salt Lake City on Saturday, the gameâs result in at least one way has been years in the making. 
Similarly, work the coaching staffs are putting in now will have bearing on the outcomes of rivalry games in the future. 
As yet another item on the list of ways the rivalry between the Utes and the Cougars is manifest, recruiting really never ends, meaning itâs part of the rivalry that doesnât sleep. 
Given the close proximity between the two schools, the strong influence of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on both campuses and the fact that the teams were in the same conference for many years, theyâve long engaged in battles for prospects. 
Despite the fact that theyâre no longer competing against one another for conference championships, those battles are still happening, particularly for in-state players. 
Just last winter, a bevy of prospects waited until late in the recruiting process â some right up until Februaryâs National Signing Day â to decide if they were going to go to BYU or Utah. 
With the trend in recent years of top high school players leaving the Beehive State to play collegiately, thereâs the desire on the part of coaches to convince top prospects to play locally. 
âThereâs always that battle to try to keep those top in-state kids home,â said Scout.com national recruiting analyst Greg Biggins. âI think itâs huge for both those two programs to try to, if they can, keep as much talent at home.â 
In somewhat of a strange sense, both the Utes and the Cougars have the same goal of keeping elite recruits in the state, yet it goes without saying they donât want them to sign with the competition, said Bigginsâ colleague at Scout, Blair Angulo, who focuses his work in the Mountain West region. 
âYouâre selling staying closer to home â thatâs kind of a recruiting pitch you put out there â but at the same time, itâs like, âDonât go to that place, come to this place,ââ he said. âItâs a plus and kind of a negative there where you kind of have to toe that line correctly.â 
Now as another crop of prospects is trying to decide which school theyâll sign with in 2017, the rivalry is rolling on, as a number of players hold scholarship offers from both schools, in addition to multiple Power 5 programs outside of the state. 
âI definitely hear stories from kids that both those two coaching staffs do a pretty good job as far as recruiting aggressively and hard,â Biggins said. âI do see it as pretty competitive.â 
The fact that Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham and BYU head man Kalani Sitake are close friends does make for an interesting dynamic in the ever-competitive recruiting process, although Whittingham this week downplayed it. 
âLike always, you recruit against the university more so than a specific coach,â he said. âWe cross paths with a few kids in-state, but other than that, thereâs not a lot of crossing paths.â 
While the consensus among prospects is that coaches from the two programs focus on selling their program and donât talk much about the other, fans are a different story. 
Cottonwoodâs Taniela Pututau , for example, said that many people in his LDS ward are Cougar fans and try to sway him to go to Provo, while his family consists largely of Ute fans since his brothers Howard and Fua are part of the program. 
In the case of Ridgelineâs Levani Damuni , he doesnât get too many in-person interactions with fans of the schools since he lives in Cache Valley (although Utah State fans do approach him about going there), but he does get comments on Twitter. 
The social media site has changed recruiting from a number of different standpoints, including the fact that fans can easily tweet at prospects with messages both about âtheirâ school, as well as that school's rivals. 
âI think every time someoneâs tweeted at me like, âCome to Utah, come to BYU,â itâs always been a positive thing,â Damuni said. âIâve seen it a lot where theyâre talking down the other school, but itâs not really to me.â 
Pututau had a similar experience when he tweeted a list of his top five schools in July, which includes both Utah and BYU (along with Oregon State, Navy and Colorado). 
âA lot of people were wanting me to just follow my brothers and continue the legacy at Utah, and then other people told me to start my own at BYU,â he said. âIt was kind of annoying when I first put out my top five because I got all these BYU notifications and then Utah notifications. It was just kind of annoying, but it slowed down after.â 
While Pututau said he tries to not put too much on Twitter to stir up fans, Laytonâs Tayler Katoa has shown to be the opposite. Over the span of four days at the end of May, he posted a pro-Cougars tweet, followed up by a pro-Utes tweet. Both my parents are BYU Alumni đ Follow the BYU legacy??? pic.twitter.com/SzlOK1Dlro

In Jim Caldwell’s eyes, it’s pretty easy to grasp the special ability of Ziggy Ansah.
“All you do is take a look at the film – you look at practice film, even – and he does things that no one else does. He has some very unusual traits and characteristics,” Caldwell said.
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who’s been studying the Lions’ defense in preparation for Sunday’s game, would agree.
“They can obviously rush the passer, with Ansah especially. He’s a special, special player,” Luck said in a conference call on Wednesday.
Ansah, a relative unknown when he entered the NFL in 2013, has quickly become a bonafide star. He finished third in the league last year with 14.5 sacks – just a half-sack shy of the Lions’ single season record – and was rewarded with a trip to the Pro Bowl.
“That’s quite an honor and that tells you right there that he’s one of the best in the league,” Caldwell said.
But the Lions’ coach still thinks the 27-year old defensive end has room to improve.
“I certainly do, and I think you’ll see that. If he can stay healthy you’ll see an even better version of him because he’s really just starting to scratch the surface of all of the things that he’s capable of doing within the context of our scheme,” Caldwell said.
Ansah finds himself in rarefied air. He is soaring into superstardom, yet the sky remains the limit. He can still get better, even while being one of the best.
The NFL’s upper echelon of defensive players? That’s not really a target anymore.
“I like to think he’s already there,” said defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. “I think he just has to keep improving. I’m not looking for any numbers or anything like that.”
Ansah’s dad is, though. He’s pushing his son to break 15 sacks this season and write his name into the Lions’ record books.
Reminded of that on Thursday, Ansah smiled and downplayed the idea of aiming for certain statistics.
“Nobody ever puts numbers to the work that I do,” he said. “I just try to improve on the previous year and that’s the best I can do.”
In that case, one reporter pointed out, 15 sacks should be his minimum target.
“Thank you,” Ansah deadpanned, before breaking into a laugh. “Good job.”
Ansah’s ascent is startling given his background. The Ghana native didn’t begin playing football until his sophomore year at Brigham Young University and didn’t make much of an impact on the field until his senior year.
You’d hardly know that watching him now.
“He’s a guy that didn’t play from the time he was 8, 9, 10 years like a lot of guys, but he has all the necessary tools to be outstanding and he has a real nasty streak in him, which is something that I think makes a tremendous difference” said Caldwell.
The coach grinned when he mentioned Ansah’s viciousness on the gridiron.
“That’s the way you play the game and he does it well,” Caldwell said.
Austin went a step further.
“This guy is as fine a football player as I’ve been around,” he said.
Asked for his thoughts on receiving such praise, the poker-faced Ansah responded in typically subtle fashion.
“I appreciate you, Teryl,” he said.

In that case, one reporter pointed out, 15 sacks should be his minimum target.
“Thank you,” Ansah deadpanned, before breaking into a laugh. “Good job.”
Ansah’s ascent is startling given his background. The Ghana native didn’t begin playing football until his sophomore year at Brigham Young University and didn’t make much of an impact on the field until his senior year.
You’d hardly know that watching him now.
“He’s a guy that didn’t play from the time he was 8, 9, 10 years like a lot of guys, but he has all the necessary tools to be outstanding and he has a real nasty streak in him, which is something that I think makes a tremendous difference” said Caldwell.
The coach grinned when he mentioned Ansah’s viciousness on the gridiron.
“That’s the way you play the game and he does it well,” Caldwell said.
Austin went a step further.
“This guy is as fine a football player as I’ve been around,” he said.
Asked for his thoughts on receiving such praise, the poker-faced Ansah responded in typically subtle fashion.
“I appreciate you, Teryl,” he said.

In Jim Caldwell’s eyes, it’s pretty easy to grasp the special ability of Ziggy Ansah.
“All you do is take a look at the film – you look at practice film, even – and he does things that no one else does. He has some very unusual traits and characteristics,” Caldwell said.
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who’s been studying the Lions’ defense in preparation for Sunday’s game, would agree.
“They can obviously rush the passer, with Ansah especially. He’s a special, special player,” Luck said in a conference call on Wednesday.
Ansah, a relative unknown when he entered the NFL in 2013, has quickly become a bonafide star. He finished third in the league last year with 14.5 sacks – just a half-sack shy of the Lions’ single season record – and was rewarded with a trip to the Pro Bowl.
“That’s quite an honor and that tells you right there that he’s one of the best in the league,” Caldwell said.
But the Lions’ coach still thinks the 27-year old defensive end has room to improve.
“I certainly do, and I think you’ll see that. If he can stay healthy you’ll see an even better version of him because he’s really just starting to scratch the surface of all of the things that he’s capable of doing within the context of our scheme,” Caldwell said.
Ansah finds himself in rarefied air. He is soaring into superstardom, yet the sky remains the limit. He can still get better, even while being one of the best.
The NFL’s upper echelon of defensive players? That’s not really a target anymore.
“I like to think he’s already there,” said defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. “I think he just has to keep improving. I’m not looking for any numbers or anything like that.”
Ansah’s dad is, though. He’s pushing his son to break 15 sacks this season and write his name into the Lions’ record books.

Lisa Riley Roche,9/8/2016 20:10,"
SALT LAKE CITY — Josh Romney said Thursday it's tough for him and his father, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to witness what may be ""permanent damage"" to the Republican Party from Donald Trump's candidacy.
The concern, Josh Romney told members of the BYU Management Society gathered at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, is that the 2016 GOP nominee has hurt the party's image with minority voters because of his statements on race and religion.
""His Hispanic and black outreach has been minimal at best and harmful in many ways,"" Romney said, noting the billionaire businessman's efforts to win a larger percentage of white voters than past GOP candidates is not a winning one.
That's because, Romney said, his father ""would have won by a bigger landslide than Ronald Regan did against Jimmy Carter"" had the nation's demographics not changed since 1980 because he received a higher percentage of the white vote than Reagan.
Republicans have to recognize the dramatic shift in the country's makeup, he said, and Trump's talking of deporting people in the country illegally, making Mexico pay to build a border wall and banning Muslims have been harmful.
""So the concern is what Donald has done. Has it caused permanent damage to the Republican brand and the Republican Party among those minorities? Or is it something we can recover from? I'm not sure,"" Romney said.
He called it ""astonishing"" that Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's pick for president, actually won their primary races and will be on the ballot in November.
What needs to happen, Romney said, is for political parties ""to revamp next time, nominate people who stand for something, that will bring us together, unite us as a country, that will tackle hard issues. I believe that can happen.""
This election year is going to be hard, especially on his father, said Romney, one of Mitt Romney's five sons.
Mitt Romney slammed Trump as a phony and a fraud in a high-profile speech at the University of Utah just before the state's March GOP presidential preference caucus vote, likely helping Trump finish a distant third.
The two-time presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor has said he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and has said he's considering the Libertarian Party ticket headed by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson.
On Wednesday, Romney tweeted for the first time in two months, telling Twitter followers he hopes voters get to see Johnson and his running mate, another former Massachusetts governor, William Weld, participate in this fall's debates.
That's fueled speculation about a possible Romney endorsement, as has a recent meeting between a top Romney adviser in 2012 and a new entry into the presidential race, Evan McMullin, a Utah native and former CIA officer.
Josh Romney said his father would ""love to be there in the fight. He was really hoping to see a young star rise out of the Republican darkness"" after toying briefly with a third White House bid.
""It's tough and it's frustrating. We still talk about it a lot. He cares a lot about this country and about the party,"" Josh Romney said. ""It's tough to see what the party is going through.""
Josh Romney called himself a believer in the Republican Party of Lincoln and Reagan, ""not Donald Trump,"" and said he hopes the GOP ""can remake our brand a little bit next go-round and be more inclusive and more optimistic.""
Josh Romney, the president of a Utah-based real estate investment firm, has said he is considering a run for governor in 2020, but Thursday told a reporter he hasn't ""made a decision on anything, but I'm considering a lot of options.""

Nick Bromberg,9/8/2016 20:12,"(Getty Images) The Iowa State student government is officially opposed to the potential addition of BYU to the Big 12. The student government passed a resolution 21-6 Wednesday night that disavows BYU’s candidacy on the basis that the school’s “discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12.” The reasoning stems from BYU’s honor code. The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints school’s honor code bars “sexual relations” between members of the same sex and “all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings.” From the Iowa State Daily: Patwa introduced the resolution to the Senate by citing an anecdote to Jack Trice, the first African-American athlete at Iowa State College. Trice died following a football game against the University of Minnesota in 1923, after sustaining injuries during the game. “[It is] widely accepted that the attack on Jack Trice was racially motivated,” Patwa said, further referencing that by passing this resolution that it’s time Student Government “take a stance to what we believe in.” Vice Speaker Conner Tillo furthered the debate, arguing that it’s their [Student Government’s] responsibility to advocate for their fellow Big 12 Universities. The resolution will be sent to Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby as well as the presidents of all conference universities. The president of the student government association at ISU spoke out against the resolution during the debate and said “a number of” student-government presidents at other Big 12 schools didn’t feel ISU’s government should be taking a stand.

The resolution is the first time an official anti-BYU statement has been made from a group with direct ties to a Big 12 school. LGBT groups have previously written to Bowlsby against BYU’s candidacy.

eliteathletetalk,9/8/2016 20:22,"Iowa State student government passes anti-BYU to Big 12 resolution
(Getty Images)
The Iowa State student government is officially opposed to the potential addition of BYU to the Big 12.
The student government passed a resolution 21-6 Wednesday night that disavows BYU’s candidacy on the basis that the school’s “discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12.”
The reasoning stems from BYU’s honor code. The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints school’s honor code bars “sexual relations” between members of the same sex and “all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings.”
From the Iowa State Daily:
Patwa introduced the resolution to the Senate by citing an anecdote to Jack Trice, the first African-American athlete at Iowa State College. Trice died following a football game against the University of Minnesota in 1923, after sustaining injuries during the game.
“[It is] widely accepted that the attack on Jack Trice was racially motivated,” Patwa said, further referencing that by passing this resolution that it’s time Student Government “take a stance to what we believe in.”
Vice Speaker Conner Tillo furthered the debate, arguing that it’s their [Student Government’s] responsibility to advocate for their fellow Big 12 Universities.
The resolution will be sent to Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby as well as the presidents of all conference universities. The president of the student government association at ISU spoke out against the resolution during the debate and said “a number of” student-government presidents at other Big 12 schools didn’t feel ISU’s government should be taking a stand.
[Listen to the Dr. Saturday Podcast to catch up on all things college football]
Here’s the student government’s official statement about the resolution to the Ames Tribune:
“Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed. The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.”
The student government’s willingness to speak out is noteworthy, even if it won’t have much, if any, impact on the Big 12’s decisions to expand to 12 or 14 teams. The resolution is the first time an official anti-BYU statement has been made from a group with direct ties to a Big 12 school. LGBT groups have previously written to Bowlsby against BYU’s candidacy.
BYU is reportedly one of approximately eight teams who are on the Big 12’s short list for expansion. While the Cougars would certainly be a boon for football within the conference, its rule against playing games on Sundays could hinder scheduling for all other sports.
Central Florida is another school reportedly being considered by the Big 12. The Orlando airport tweeted about a meeting between the conference and UCF Wednesday morning, though the tweet no longer exists as of Wednesday afternoon.

maycij,9/8/2016 20:26,"2015 was without a doubt, the most challenging and difficult year in my life.  It was the year where I faced the biggest trials and roadblocks in my 20 years on this earth so far.  But, by facing these trials, challenges and obstacles, I made significant changes in my life which has helped me become the person I am today.  These experiences have given me more compassion and understanding of others and have helped me realize that I can better relate and share my experiences to help others through news media.
There are three dates in my life that I will never forget, and they all happened in 2015. These dates are very significant to me because they have molded and shaped my life into what it is now.  The first date I will mention is the one that flipped my life upside down. I still remember the day like it was yesterday, sitting on my bed in disbelief that my life was going to drastically change forever. I was scared because, for once, my life was completely out of my hands.
February 1st 2015 was the day that I found out I was pregnant. Finding out you are going to be a parent is supposed to be a joyous thing, but being unmarried and a D1 collegiate tennis player, this was anything but great news for me.  At this point I felt like my life was over.  My scholarship, my freedom, my education, basically everything I worked for felt like it was going to be ripped out of my hands.  Two weeks later when I finally had the courage to accept my pregnancy, I was in the offices of University officials including our Athletic Director.  From those conversations I decided that the best decision for me and BYU was to withdraw from school.  I left BYU with sadness and regret because of my poor choices.  I lost tennis, I lost school, I lost friends, I lost self-worth.
Just when I thought it couldn't be worse, March 24th 2015 became the worst day of my life.  This was the day that my boyfriend, the father of my unborn child, passed away in a car accident.  Words can't even describe the emotions I had that day, knowing that I was going to be a single mother and my son would never meet his father.  My life felt meaningless and hopeless, and I struggled to get by as I tried to accept my new reality.  Despite my emotions, I knew that God had a plan for me.  I was able to discover the beauties of life and death through the process of repentance I was going through.
September 21st 2015 was by far the best day of my life.  This was the day that my beautiful son was brought to earth.  Life once again had purpose, and meaning.  Life was absolutely beautiful once again.
These dates are the most ground breaking events in my life history.  Each specific date took part in molding the new Mayci Jones.  February 1st 2015 made me wiser, it forced me to realize that I was not living my life how I should, and I needed to make a change.  March 24th 2015 made me stronger. Since the death of my boyfriend I have been able to overcome my trials a lot easier and recognize the beauty of God's plan.  September 21st 2015 helped me develop greater kindness, compassion, and love.  I am now a better person as a result. The purpose of sharing these dates is to show the person I have become.
After having my son Hudson, I knew I could not just crawl up in a ball and hope my problems would go away.  I knew I had a purpose and I worked as hard as I could to come back to BYU.  There were strict and lengthy requirements, including classes that would have to be completed  in tight time frames and personal development goals that would need to be met.  I knew that BYU was my future if I was so fortunate to be allowed to return.  I owed it to my team and coach to return and play tennis and I owed it to myself and my future to pursue my education and love for news media.
The purpose of explaining those significant three dates in 2015 is to show how far I have come in life.  I am thankful for my trials because they have humbled me and turned me into the person I have always wanted to be.  Since having Hudson, I have also succeeded in other aspects of my life.  I get better grades than ever before because I take school and my future career very seriously. Being a mom helps me to prioritize my time wisely.
I believe that I would be great for the broadcasting journalism program at BYU for many reasons. I am outgoing and I'm always ready to accept a challenge.  I have proven through my life experiences that I can face even the most difficult trials and still persevere.  I am very competitive.  As an athlete at BYU, I have learned to compete at a very high level, which I think translates very well into the work atmosphere.  My competitive nature drives me to work hard and not give up until I succeed.  In addition, I have also had first hand experience with broadcasting and social media from interning with ABC 4, on the morning show Good Things Utah.  Working there taught me a lot about the production side of broadcasting.  It also taught me about being in front of the camera and how to draw in the attention of an audience.  I loved every day that I worked as an intern and my passion for the news media business grew tremendously during this time.  In addition to this relevant work experience, I have also been involved in a leadership role as a member of the Student Athletic Advisory Committee.  As well as being involved in leadership roles, I have a great sense of social media and have been featured on the cover of BYU's SnapChat story.
All of the trials, hardships and challenges I have successfully overcome have given me the experience and compassion needed to be successful in the news media business.  I know that I would be a hardworking and humble leader.  I have passion for the business, I am committed to being a shining example to others and I am confident that I can make significant contributions if given the opportunity in the news media writing program.

pahomepage.com,9/8/2016 20:26,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 12:21PM
Updated 09/08 2016 12:21PM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Talk 99.5,9/8/2016 20:27,"Is this 1,700-year-old tablet the world's oldest obituary?
(CNN) A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians at the time. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
The reference to the woman's faith is what makes this translation significant, Blumell said.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

The Associated Press,9/8/2016 20:29,"
By MICHELLE L. PRICE - 9/8/16 4:52 PM 
SALT LAKE CITY — Republican nominee Donald Trump leaves many in Utah cold despite the state’s deep-red credentials, but voters eyeing third-party candidate Gary Johnson may be feeling some whiplash Thursday. 
The day after political heavyweight Mitt Romney name-dropped him on Twitter, the former New Mexico governor seemed to reveal a hole in his foreign-affairs knowledge when he was befuddled by an otherwise routine question about the Syrian city of Aleppo. 
Johnson, whose campaign is based in Salt Lake City, received national attention Thursday morning after he was asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” what he would do as president about the Syrian city at the center of the refugee crisis, Johnson replied, “And what is Aleppo?” 
Johnson later acknowledged the error, saying he “blanked” and had been thinking of an acronym, not the Syrian city. 
The interview came less than 24 hours after Mitt Romney, a high profile critic of Donald Trump, emerged from a relative silence on Twitter to say, “I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall.” 
Chris Karpowitz, a political science professor at Brigham Young University, said it’s unclear how much of an effect Romney’s message and Johnson’s misstep will have in Utah, where the overwhelmingly conservative state has given a relatively lukewarm response for Trump. 
Foreign policy isn’t high on the priority for a lot of voters, but “it certainly wasn’t a great moment for Gary Johnson,” Karpowitz said. 
Karpowitz said Romney is a respected voice in Utah but the tweet may not give Johnson much of a boost. It wasn’t a full-throated endorsement and the election battle at this point is centered around Trump and Clinton and Romney has “yielded the stage.” 
Romney, among the most high-profile Mormons in America, remains very popular in Utah, a state where more than 60 percent of residents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Jonathan Choate, a Johnson supporter from Logan, said he thinks Romney’s tweet will encourage more Utah voters to give Johnson serious consideration, but he’d love to see a Romney endorsement. 
“I think it is the appropriate time for him to step up and make definitive statements rather than hints,” Choate said. “We’re past the hinting stages.” 
Choate said Johnson’s response to the Aleppo question might hurt him with Utah voters, but he thinks it was an understandable mistake because Johnson was asked the question without proper context about Syria. 
The misstep comes after another Johnson made this summer that linked Mormons to violence, Karpowitz noted. 
In an interview in July with the Washington Examiner, Johnson said he didn’t support religious freedom exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, saying, “Back to Mormonism. Why shouldn’t somebody be able to shoot somebody else because their freedom of religion says that God has spoken to them and that they can shoot somebody dead.” 
His campaign later issued an apology in a statement calling the comment a “very imprecise reference to the violence that accompanied the Mormon’s early history in the 1800s.”

Tipoff times, TV schedule finalized for CU Buffs men's basketball Coach Tad Boyle's club to appear on ESPN networks 15 times Posted: 09/08/2016 01:44:59 PM MDT Updated: 09/08/2016 02:30:50 PM MDT George King and the Colorado men's basketball team will make 10 appearances on ESPN networks during the 2016-17 season. ( Jeremy Papasso / Staff Photographer ) 
After reaching the NCAA Tournament in four of the past five seasons, the University of Colorado men's basketball team will enjoy its fair share of national television appearances during the 2016-17 season. 
The Pac-12 Conference announced the full game schedule and television information for the upcoming season on Thursday, with the Buffaloes slotted to appear regularly on national television. Highlighting the slate are 10 appearances on ESPN's family of networks and a Feb. 19 date at defending league champion Oregon that will be featured as the Saturday afternoon national game of the week on FOX. 
CU also will appear on FS1 three times, with another 15 games scheduled to be aired by the Pac-12 Networks. 
Tipoff times have been finalized for every game except the Buffs' home date against Washington on Feb. 9. CU begins the season with three consecutive home games against Sacramento State (Nov. 11), Seattle (Nov. 14), and Louisiana-Monroe (Nov. 17) that all begin at 7 p.m. and will air on the Pac-12 Networks. 
CU makes its first appearance on ESPN2 while taking on Notre Dame Nov. 21 at the Barclays Center in New York as part of the Legends Classic. The Buffs' game the next day against either Texas or Northwestern also will air on either ESPN2 or ESPNU. 
CU's annual rivalry battle against Colorado State on Nov. 30 will tip off at 7 p.m. at the Coors Events Center and air on the Pac-12 Networks. The Buffs begin Pac-12 Conference play with three consecutive road games, beginning New Year's Day with an afternoon date at Utah set to air on ESPNU. Advertisement

MS SportsNet,9/8/2016 20:30,"A European scientific study has concluded that on September 11, 2001, the Twin Towers were brought down by a controlled demolition.
The study, conducted by four physicists and published in Europhysics Magazine (page 23), says that “the evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that all three buildings were destroyed by controlled demolition.”
“Given the far-reaching implications, it is morally imperative that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific and impartial investigation by responsible authorities,” the four physicists conclude.
The study is the work of Steven Jones, former full professor of physics at Brigham Young University, Robert Korol, a professor emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, Anthony Szamboti, a mechanical design engineer with over 25 years of structural design experience in the aerospace and communications industries, and Ted Walter, the director of strategy and development for Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a nonprofit organization that today represents more than 2,500 architects and engineers.
Conscious of the controversial nature of the report Europhysics included an editor’s note with the study in the September 2016 issue:
“This feature is somewhat different from our usual purely scientific articles, in that it contains some speculation.
“However, given the timing and the importance of the issue, we consider that this feature is sufficiently technical and interesting to merit publication for our readers. Obviously, the content of this article is the responsibility of the authors.”
In August 2002, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology launched what would become a six-year investigation of the three building failures that occurred on 9/11.
It found both the Twin Towers, as well as the 47-story World Trade Center Building 7, which was not struck by an airplane, all collapsed as a result of fires and intense heat.
But even the NIST found that the three buildings were “the only known cases of total structural collapse in high-rise buildings where fires played a significant role.”
“It bears repeating that fires have never caused the total collapse of a steel-framed high-rise before or since 9/11,” the researchers write.
“Did we witness an unprecedented event three separate times on September 11, 2001?”
The report also concluded:
“Given the far-reaching implications, it is morally imperative that this hypothesis be the subject of a truly scientific and impartial investigation by responsible authorities.”
The researchers also found “the only phenomenon capable of collapsing such buildings completely has been by way of a procedure known as controlled demolition, whereby explosives or other devices are used to bring down a structure intentionally.”
They noted that “15 years after the event a growing number of architects, engineers, and scientists are unconvinced by that explanation.”
Here are some of the observations the researchers offered:
    Fires typically are not hot enough and do not last long enough in any single area to generate enough energy to heat the large structural members to the point where they fail (the temperature at which structural steel loses enough strength to fail is dependent on the factor of safety used in the design. In the case of WTC 7, for example, the factor of safety was generally 3 or higher. Here, 67 percent of the strength would need to be lost for failure to ensue, which would require the steel to be heated to about 660°C);
    Most high-rises have fire suppression systems (water sprinklers), which further prevent a fire from releasing sufficient energy to heat the steel to a critical failure state;
    Structural members are protected by fireproofing materials, which are designed to prevent them from reaching failure temperatures within specified time periods;
    Steel-framed high-rises are designed to be highly redundant structural systems. Thus, if a localized failure occurs, it does not result in a disproportionate collapse of the entire structure. Throughout history, three steel-framed high-rises are known to have suffered partial collapses due to fires; none of those led to a total collapse. Countless other steel-framed high-rises have experienced large, long-lasting fires without suffering either partial or total collapse. In addition to resisting ever-present gravity loads and occasional fires, high-rises must be designed to resist loads generated during other extreme events – in particular, high winds and earthquakes.
The physicists also note the Towers were specifically designed to withstand the impact and destructive force of airliners crashes.
They write:
“The total collapse of WTC 7 at 5:20 pm on 9/11, is remarkable because it exemplified all the signature features of an implosion: The building dropped in absolute free fall for the first 2.25 seconds of its descent over a distance of 32 meters or eight stories.
“Its transition from stasis to free fall was sudden, occurring in approximately one-half second. It fell symmetrically straight down. Its steel frame was almost entirely dismembered and deposited mostly inside the building’s footprint, while most of its concrete was pulverized into tiny particles.
“Finally, the collapse was rapid, occurring in less than seven seconds. Given the nature of the collapse, any investigation adhering to the scientific method should have seriously considered the controlled demolition hypothesis, if not started with it.
“Instead, NIST (as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which conducted a preliminary study prior to the NIST investigation) began with the predetermined conclusion that the collapse was caused by fires.”
The original investigations did note:
“The specifics of the fires in WTC 7 and how they caused the building to collapse remain unknown at this time. Although the total diesel fuel on the premises contained massive potential energy, the best hypothesis has only a low probability of occurrence.”
On March 2006, the NIST’s lead investigator, Dr. Shyam Sunder, was quoted as saying:
“Truthfully, I don’t really know. We’ve had trouble getting a handle on building No. 7.”
“The collapse mechanics discussed above are only a fraction of the available evidence indicating that the airplane impacts and ensuing fires did not cause the collapse of the Twin Towers,” the report says.
“Videos show that the upper section of each tower disintegrated within the first four seconds of collapse.
“After that point, not a single video shows the upper sections that purportedly descended all the way to the ground before being crushed. Videos and photographs also show numerous high-velocity bursts of debris being ejected from point-like sources.
“NIST refers to these as “puffs of smoke” but fails to properly analyze them. NIST also provides no explanation for the midair pulverization of most of the towers’ concrete, the near-total dismemberment of their steel frames, or the ejection of those materials up to 150 meters in all directions.”

While the University of Utah and BYU football teams are preparing this week to face one another in Salt Lake City on Saturday, the game’s result in at least one way has been years in the making.
Similarly, work the coaching staffs are putting in now will have bearing on the outcomes of rivalry games in the future.
As yet another item on the list of ways the rivalry between the Utes and the Cougars is manifest, recruiting really never ends, meaning it’s part of the rivalry that doesn’t sleep.
Given the close proximity between the two schools, the strong influence of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on both campuses and the fact that the teams were in the same conference for many years, they’ve long engaged in battles for prospects.
Despite the fact that they’re no longer competing against one another for conference championships, those battles are still happening, particularly for in-state players.
Just last winter, a bevy of prospects waited until late in the recruiting process — some right up until February’s National Signing Day — to decide if they were going to go to BYU or Utah.
With the trend in recent years of top high school players leaving the Beehive State to play collegiately, there’s the desire on the part of coaches to convince top prospects to play locally.
“There’s always that battle to try to keep those top in-state kids home,” said Scout.com national recruiting analyst Greg Biggins. “I think it’s huge for both those two programs to try to, if they can, keep as much talent at home.”
In somewhat of a strange sense, both the Utes and the Cougars have the same goal of keeping elite recruits in the state, yet it goes without saying they don’t want them to sign with the competition, said Biggins’ colleague at Scout, Blair Angulo, who focuses his work in the Mountain West region.
“You’re selling staying closer to home — that’s kind of a recruiting pitch you put out there — but at the same time, it’s like, ‘Don’t go to that place, come to this place,’” he said. “It’s a plus and kind of a negative there where you kind of have to toe that line correctly.”
Now as another crop of prospects is trying to decide which school they’ll sign with in 2017, the rivalry is rolling on, as a number of players hold scholarship offers from both schools, in addition to multiple Power 5 programs outside of the state.
“I definitely hear stories from kids that both those two coaching staffs do a pretty good job as far as recruiting aggressively and hard,” Biggins said. “I do see it as pretty competitive.”
The fact that Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham and BYU head man Kalani Sitake are close friends does make for an interesting dynamic in the ever-competitive recruiting process, although Whittingham this week downplayed it.
“Like always, you recruit against the university more so than a specific coach,” he said. “We cross paths with a few kids in-state, but other than that, there’s not a lot of crossing paths.”
While the consensus among prospects is that coaches from the two programs focus on selling their program and don’t talk much about the other, fans are a different story.
Cottonwood’s Taniela Pututau, for example, said that many people in his LDS ward are Cougar fans and try to sway him to go to Provo, while his family consists largely of Ute fans since his brothers Howard and Fua are part of the program.
In the case of Ridgeline’s Levani Damuni, he doesn’t get too many in-person interactions with fans of the schools since he lives in Cache Valley (although Utah State fans do approach him about going there), but he does get comments on Twitter.
The social media site has changed recruiting from a number of different standpoints, including the fact that fans can easily tweet at prospects with messages both about “their” school, as well as that school's rivals.
“I think every time someone’s tweeted at me like, ‘Come to Utah, come to BYU,’ it’s always been a positive thing,” Damuni said. “I’ve seen it a lot where they’re talking down the other school, but it’s not really to me.”
Pututau had a similar experience when he tweeted a list of his top five schools in July, which includes both Utah and BYU (along with Oregon State, Navy and Colorado).
“A lot of people were wanting me to just follow my brothers and continue the legacy at Utah, and then other people told me to start my own at BYU,” he said. “It was kind of annoying when I first put out my top five because I got all these BYU notifications and then Utah notifications. It was just kind of annoying, but it slowed down after.”
While Pututau said he tries to not put too much on Twitter to stir up fans, Layton’s Tayler Katoa has shown to be the opposite. Over the span of four days at the end of May, he posted a pro-Cougars tweet, followed up by a pro-Utes tweet.
Both my parents are BYU Alumni 💙 Follow the BYU legacy??? pic.twitter.com/SzlOK1Dlro
— TK (@TaylerKatoa) May 25, 2016
UTAHHHH ⚪🔴 #HometownHero? pic.twitter.com/OHx4PyORdn
— TK (@TaylerKatoa) May 29, 2016
In July, he tweeted that BYU going to the Big 12 could make for an intriguing development in his recruiting process.
If BYU gets in to the BIG 12🤔🤔🤔 hmmm interesting.... #BYUtoBig12
— TK (@TaylerKatoa) July 25, 2016
On Tuesday, he posted a poll asking which team will win on Saturday. Soon after, a BYU fan replied asking if the outcome would affect Katoa’s recruiting, followed a few minutes later by a Utah fan offering his support for Saturday’s home team.
@TaylerKatoa Does the outcome sway recruiting for you?
— Nic Cotton (@cougs_cotton) September 7, 2016
@TaylerKatoa Go UTES
— Ray mara (@Raymara1000) September 7, 2016
In addition to both of his parents having been Cougars, Katoa's sister Eliza is on the Ute volleyball team.
Although Damuni said Twitter can get kind of crazy when he shares recruiting material from a school or something that has been written about him, he likes the fact that fans are involved in the process.
“I don’t think it gets annoying,” he said. “I think it’s pretty cool to see the schools’ fan bases on social media supporting the team and trying to recruit players in a way.”
Still, he doesn’t see fan input having much of a bearing on where he’ll ultimately decide to go.
“The fan base is important, but I’m not going to let fans influence me,” he said.
Although not on social media, one area fans could help play a role in recruiting this weekend is at Rice-Eccles Stadium. A slew of in-state prospects will be attending the game as unofficial visitors of the Utes (with a number of out-of-state prospects coming on official visits as well), something Biggins sees as a bit of an advantage for Utah in the recruiting process.
“You rarely see a kid make a decision because of that one game. In saying that, you’d still much rather have the game at your place than their place,” Biggins said. “It still creates a lot of buzz, a lot of positive vibes moving forward.”
That said, Angulo feels both schools have a lot to gain in recruiting this weekend with so many prospects from multiple graduating classes slated to be at the game.
“They’re there to see both schools,” he said. “In that regard, it’s really helpful for the recruits to have both of these options right in front of them and experience that game atmosphere.”

The BYU women’s volleyball team went 3-0 in the Sports Imports D.C. Koehl Classic tournament this weekend in Ohio to continue their undefeated record (6-0). 
Head coach Heather Olmstead was proud of her team’s effort. 
“The team never gave up and everybody contributed. I’m really happy for the team,” Olmstead said. 
Tournament play began Friday morning with the Cougars facing off against Wyoming for the first time since 2010 with BYU winning 69 of the 74 times they’ve played in total. Veronica Jones-Perry was a stand out player during the match with 11 kills on a .276 clip. 
The Cougars carried the victory momentum to their match later that evening against Long Island University Brooklyn. 
BYU defeated the Blackbirds in three quick sets (25-16, 25-8, 25-13) with Jones-Perry continuing to lead BYU with 14 kills and five digs. Cosy Burnett also put up 10 kills on a .667 clip while Mary Lake contributed 13 digs. 
BYU was previously undefeated against Ohio State but this match proved to be a different story. The No. 11 Buckeyes pulled ahead early in the first set then won a tightly contested second set (26-24) as well. 
However, the Cougars charged back and won the third set with an incredible lead of 21-2. This set proved to be shift of momentum as Buckeyes errors continued rampant and freshman McKenna Miller put away seven kills. BYU didn’t look back and won the next to sets and ultimately the tournament. The BYU women’s volleyball team celebrates after scoring a point at the DC Sports Koehl Classic. (BYU Photo) 
“We treated the Ohio State game like any other game,” Lake said. “At the beginning we we’re shaken up, a little scared and intimidated but we had to focus on the things we can control.” 
Miller and Lake were key components to of the win over Ohio State. Miller had a career-high 31 kills which was the second-most all-time in one set in BYU rally-scoring history. 
“I want to keep contributing how the team needs me to play, whatever I end up doing if it’s on the bench or on the court I want to get better as player and help the team grow,” Miller said. 
Lake contributed a career-high 38 digs which is also the second-most all-time in the BYU rally-scoring era. Amy Boswell added a match-high 5 blocks and 13 kills. Lake and Boswell were added to the all-tournament team and Lake was named Most Valuable Player of the tournament. 
The Cougars will head to face Boise State, Missouri and Idaho State in the Idaho State Invitational next weekend then take on rival University of Utah in the Deseret Duel at home on Thursday, September 15.

KEYT3,9/8/2016 20:38,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
POSTED: 07:10 AM PDT Sep 08, 2016 UPDATED: 09:21 AM PDT Sep 08, 2016
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Teryl Austin: Ziggy Ansah ‘As Fine A Football Player As I’ve Been Around’ September 8, 2016 4:09 PM Ezekiel Ansah #94 of the Detroit Lions (Photo by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images) 
By Will Burchfield, @burchie_kid 
In Jim Caldwell’s eyes, it’s pretty easy to grasp the special ability of Ziggy Ansah. 
“All you do is take a look at the film – you look at practice film, even – and he does things that no one else does. He has some very unusual traits and characteristics,” Caldwell said. 
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who’s been studying the Lions’ defense in preparation for Sunday’s game, would agree. 
“They can obviously rush the passer, with Ansah especially. He’s a special, special player,” Luck said in a conference call on Wednesday. 
Ansah, a relative unknown when he entered the NFL in 2013, has blossomed into a bonafide star. He finished third in the league last year with 14.5 sacks – just a half-sack shy of the Lions’ single season record – and was rewarded with a trip to the Pro Bowl. 
“That’s quite an honor and that tells you right there that he’s one of the best in the league,” Caldwell said. 
But the Lions’ coach still thinks the 27-year-old defensive end has room to improve. 
“I certainly do, and I think you’ll see that. If he can stay healthy you’ll see an even better version of him because he’s really just starting to scratch the surface of all of the things that he’s capable of doing within the context of our scheme,” Caldwell said. 
Ansah finds himself in rarefied air. He is soaring into superstardom, yet the sky remains the limit. He can still get better, even while being one of the best. 
The NFL’s upper echelon of defensive players? That’s not really a target anymore. 
“I like to think he’s already there,” said defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. “I think he just has to keep improving. I’m not looking for any numbers or anything like that.” 
Ansah’s dad is, though. He’s pushing his son to break 15 sacks this season and write his name into the Lions’ record books. 
Reminded of that on Thursday, Ansah smiled and downplayed the idea of aiming for certain statistics. 
“Nobody ever puts numbers to the work that I do,” he said. “I just try to improve on the previous year and that’s the best I can do.” 
In that case, one reporter pointed out, 15 sacks should be his minimum target. 
“Thank you,” Ansah deadpanned, before breaking into a laugh. “Good job.” 
Ansah’s ascent is startling given his background. The Ghana native didn’t begin playing football until his sophomore year at Brigham Young University and didn’t make much of an impact on the field until his senior year. 
You’d hardly know that watching him now. 
“He’s a guy that didn’t play from the time he was 8, 9, 10 years like a lot of guys, but he has all the necessary tools to be outstanding and he has a real nasty streak in him, which is something that I think makes a tremendous difference” said Caldwell. 
The coach grinned when he mentioned Ansah’s viciousness on the gridiron. 
“That’s the way you play the game and he does it well,” Caldwell said. 
Austin went a step further. 
“This guy is as fine a football player as I’ve been around,” he said. 
Asked for his thoughts on receiving such praise, the poker-faced Ansah responded in typically subtle fashion. 
“I appreciate you, Teryl,” he said.

Keith Koons,9/8/2016 20:47,"Jordan Cameron will be facing his former college coach Sunday when the Dolphins take on Pete Carroll and the Seattle Seahawks, but this isn’t your average reunion.
Cameron put it simply when asked what stood out from his time with Carroll at USC in 2008-09.
“He’s the reason that I’m here now,” Cameron said.
Indeed, if it hadn’t been for Pete Carroll, chances are Cameron never would have played college football, therefore never would have played in the NFL.
Remember that Cameron was a basketball player at Brigham Young University when he started playing college sports, but that changed when he went out to run routes for his younger brother Colby, a high school quarterback looking to get noticed.
Except it was Jordan that Carroll and assistant Steve Sarkisian noticed that day in May 2007 and even though they weren’t allowed to talk to him because he was under scholarship at another school, they found a way to make it clear they thought he had a future in football.
“I never thought I’d be playing football ever again after high school,” Cameron said. “Long story short, he’s the reason I’m playing now. He recruited me. I guess he has a lot to do with my whole career. It’s going to be cool playing against him. I played against him my rookie year, so I’m familiar with it and I know he’s going to get those guys right and they’re going to be ready to roll.”
As fate would have it, Cameron’s game against Carroll and the Seahawks in 2011 marked his NFL debut after he had been a fourth-round pick of the Cleveland Browns that spring. Cameron didn’t catch any passes that day as a backup behind starting tight ends Ben Watson and Alex Smith.
Cameron has come a long way since then, with a Pro Bowl on his resume, fulfilling the promise that Pete Carroll saw in him almost a decade ago.
“When I got to USC, he saw my high school tape and saw my junior college tape and he’s like, you look comfortable at receiver, we’ll try you out there and then we’ll move you to tight end as you get older and gain a little more weight,” Cameron said. “And then he left (in 2010) and (Lane) Kiffin switched me to tight end.
“After I got my release (from BYU), I talked to him and he just said he saw just an athletic guy that was fluid, was big enough and I thought I had a frame to gain some more weight and they just thought I had a shot at the NFL and I could be a threat at tight end.”
DEALING WITH CENTURYLINK
In addition to facing one of the best teams in the NFL in recent years, the Dolphins also will have to play at one of the loudest, toughest venues in the league Sunday.
CenturyLink Field, with its “12th Man,” has earned the reputation as one of the most challenging places to play, but former Seahawks cornerback Byron Maxwell refuses to make a big deal about it.
“Really, I don't address stuff like that,” he said. “I treat it as a normal away game. The first game of the season, you'll have some jitters. It's just going out there and having fun. Football is football. If you make it bigger than what it should be, that's when you start to get into trouble. You need to run and hit and play ball. That's it.""
Veteran offensive lineman Jermon Bushrod has played just about everywhere during his nine NFL seasons, and he listed Seattle,  New Orleans and Kansas City as having the loudest stadiums in the NFL.
He says communication will be key for the Dolphins on Sunday.
“We have to make sure up front that our communication is on point,” he said. “That’s what we’re working toward every day here at practice. We all have to be on the same page, and that’s not just offensive line, that’s everyone on the offense. We all have to be on the same page, and we can’t let the noise be a distraction.”
Dolphins players who have never played in Seattle have been told what to expect Sunday.
“It’s a tough place to play,” quarterback Ryan Tannehill said. “I obviously haven’t played there yet, but it has a reputation, and it’s for a reason. Some guys in the locker room played there, and they’ll tell you it’s one of the loudest places — if not the loudest in the league — you’ll play. We understand that going in there, it’s going to be a tough place to play, but we have to find a way to overcome that and find a way to win.”  
As one would expect given his feisty personality and style, wide receiver Jarvis Landry is looking forward to playing in that kind of frenzied atmosphere.
“I think for me, being in the craziest environments that I’ve been in has been the atmosphere that I’ve been in in college,” he said. “I get that vibe a lot just hearing from guys who’ve played there — it kind of feels like a college atmosphere. I tend to thrive in those venues, so I’m excited about the crowd, the challenge and I’m excited about our team, to go in there and compete.”
LAST WORD
DT Ndamukong Suhh on how different the intensity is between preseason games and regular season games: “We call it live bullets. At the end of the day, we were shooting blanks in preseason — just working on our craft and focusing on individual things. All these games particularly count now. The intensity just goes up. Say, if we’re at 100 for preseason, we’re going up to 150.”

wyo4news,9/8/2016 20:49,"The University of Wyoming Cowgirl volleyball team will host its lone non-conference tournament this weekend in the UniWyo Sports Complex.
The Cowgirls will welcome Samford, CSUN and Eastern Washington to Laramie for the UniWyo Invite, presented by UniWyo Federal Credit Union.
UW will play at 6:30 p.m., on Friday against Samford before playing at noon on Saturday against the CSUN Matadors. Wyoming will then close out the tournament at 7 p.m. against Big Sky Conference member Eastern Washington.
Friday’s match with the Bulldogs will be the first-ever meeting between the two schools, as the all-time series with CSUN is tied 1-1 with Wyoming winning the last meeting in 1991.
UW holds a 2-0 all-time advantage against the Eastern Washington Eagles. Wyoming is coming off a straight-set victory over LIU Brooklyn on Saturday, before falling to then-ranked No. 11 Ohio State and No. 10 BYU.
“Any team may feel a little more comfortable in their own facility,” UW head coach Chad Callihan said. “It will be nice to be home and be in an environment we are used to. There were several positives from this past weekend, even though the scoreboard may not have reflected that. I think we have handled the past couple of weeks pretty well. At times, we we’ve still trying to figure out our side of the net and what our identity is, but I expect the chemistry to strengthen. We know that these teams are well balanced, so we need to make sure we are ready to come out and compete.”
Redshirt freshman Bayly Poor was named to the All-Tournament team at the Sports Imports D.C. Koehl Classic this past weekend. She recorded 20 kills (2.86 kps) and 11 digs, in addition to making her first career start against No. 11 Ohio State.
Through seven matches this season, seniors Laura Beach (2.41 kps) and Kayla Slofkiss (2.32 kps) lead UW offensively with 53 and 51 kills, respectively. Slofkiss is also second on the team with 70 digs.
Senior setter Courtney Chacon has recorded 174 assists (7.91 aps), while junior defensive specialist Lily Austin has a team-high 93 digs (4.23 dps). Sophomore middle blocker Reed Copeland has 23 (1.05 bps) total blocks for the Cowgirls.
The Samford Bulldogs are 5-2 on the season and have been led by redshirt sophomore outside hitter Katie Neisler with 92 kills (4.00 kps). Most recently, Samford swept through its own tournament last weekend. They picked up wins over Radford, Tennessee Tech and Northwestern State.
Senior outside hitter Erin Bognar is close behind and second on the team with 86 kills (4.10 kps). Senior setter Erika Pifer has a team-high 222 assists (9.25 aps), while freshman outside hitter Grace Tiesman has recorded 83 digs (3.46 dps). Additionally, redshirt junior middle blocker T.J. Russell has 28 total blocks (1.17 bps) for the Bulldogs.
The CSUN Matadors hold a 3-3 record after winning twice at the UNLV Invite. The Matadors defeated Hofstra in five sets before sweeping Sacramento State last weekend.
Senior outside hitter Julie Haake has a team-best 102 kills on the year, while sophomore outside hitter Aeryn Owens is second on the team with 84. Junior setter Lauren Conati has recorded 254 assists and has an average of 10.16 per set, as junior defensive specialist Katie Sato has 117 digs (4.68 dps) on the season.
The Eastern Washington Eagles also have a 3-3 mark on the season. At the Grand Canyon University tournament this past weekend, EWU defeated Cal State Fullerton in straight sets, before claiming a comeback victory over Eastern Kentucky.
Sophomore outside hitter Jessica Gilbert leads EWU with 59 kills (2.95 kps) on the season, she also has 12 total blocks. Redshirt sophomore middle blocker Kimberly Brinkworth has a team-best 17 blocks (0.85 bps) for the Eagles. Senior setter Sophie Miller has 163 assists (8.15 aps), while junior defensive specialist Megan LaFond has 59 digs (4.21 dps).

MICHELLE L. PRICE Associated Press,9/8/2016 20:50,"
As Utah heavyweight Romney weighs in, Gary Johnson stumbles Associated Press | 0 comments 
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Republican nominee Donald Trump leaves many in Utah cold despite the state's deep-red credentials, but voters eyeing third-party candidate Gary Johnson may be feeling some whiplash Thursday. 
The day after political heavyweight Mitt Romney name-dropped him on Twitter, the former New Mexico governor seemed to reveal a hole in his foreign-affairs knowledge when he was befuddled by an otherwise routine question about the Syrian city of Aleppo. 
Johnson, whose campaign is based in Salt Lake City, received national attention Thursday morning after he was asked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" what he would do as president about the Syrian city at the center of the refugee crisis, Johnson replied, ""And what is Aleppo?"" 
Johnson later acknowledged the error, saying he ""blanked"" and had been thinking of an acronym, not the Syrian city. 
The interview came less than 24 hours after Mitt Romney, a high profile critic of Donald Trump, emerged from a relative silence on Twitter to say, ""I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall."" 
Chris Karpowitz, a political science professor at Brigham Young University, said it's unclear how much of an effect Romney's message and Johnson's misstep will have in Utah, where the overwhelmingly conservative state has given a relatively lukewarm response for Trump. 
Foreign policy isn't high on the priority for a lot of voters, but ""it certainly wasn't a great moment for Gary Johnson,"" Karpowitz said. 
Karpowitz said Romney is a respected voice in Utah but the tweet may not give Johnson much of a boost. It wasn't a full-throated endorsement and the election battle at this point is centered around Trump and Clinton and Romney has ""yielded the stage."" 
Romney, among the most high-profile Mormons in America, remains very popular in Utah, a state where more than 60 percent of residents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Jonathan Choate, a Johnson supporter from Logan, said he thinks Romney's tweet will encourage more Utah voters to give Johnson serious consideration, but he'd love to see a Romney endorsement. 
""I think it is the appropriate time for him to step up and make definitive statements rather than hints,"" Choate said. ""We're past the hinting stages."" 
Choate said Johnson's response to the Aleppo question might hurt him with Utah voters, but he thinks it was an understandable mistake because Johnson was asked the question without proper context about Syria. 
The misstep comes after another Johnson made this summer that linked Mormons to violence, Karpowitz noted. 
In an interview in July with the Washington Examiner, Johnson said he didn't support religious freedom exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, saying, ""Back to Mormonism. Why shouldn't somebody be able to shoot somebody else because their freedom of religion says that God has spoken to them and that they can shoot somebody dead."" 
His campaign later issued an apology in a statement calling the comment a ""very imprecise reference to the violence that accompanied the Mormon's early history in the 1800s.""

1,700-year-old obituary translated
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published On: Sep 08 2016 09:10:15 AM CDT Updated On: Sep 08 2016 11:21:52 AM CDT
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Daily Utah Chronicle,9/8/2016 20:52,"Harrison Handley: From BYU Fan To Utah Tight End
Emilee White
on September 8, 2016 at 10:00 am
When junior tight end Harrison Handley was younger, he use to always cheer for Brigham Young University just because his dad use to play there.
'Honestly though, I wasn't a die-hard fan,' Handley said. 'I would just go to the games because it was a football game to go to.'
When making his decision on where to go to school, Handley said the fact that his dad played for BYU didn't impact his decision, adding that his dad supported his recruiting and where he decided to go.
'He just wanted me to make my decision for me and wanted me to really explore where I wanted to go so my dad was really cool about not pushing me one way or another,' Handley said. 'I am really blessed to have a dad like that.'
Handley took a recruiting trip to BYU while he was in high school, but said that he is definitely a Ute through and through now, and he even got his dad to cheer for Utah as well.
'[My dad] is definitely a Ute right now,' Handley said. 'It’s all Utah. I got him wearing the red. I've converted most of the family over, but I'm still working on a few. When I chose to go to Utah, everyone in my family started wearing red and going to the Utah games and cheering me on in the stands. I'm really blessed with a really supportive family.'
Harrison’s mom, Laura, said that while her husband will always be a BYU fan, ever since Harrison went to the U, her husband switched over to Utah, buying all the Utah gear and going to all of Harrison’s games.
'We are all just excited to be Utah fans,' Laura said. 'His dad didn't hesitate for one second to be a Utah fan.'
While Handley dad’s went to BYU, his mom graduated from Utah. When Harrison decided to go to Utah, Laura thought it was great, adding that she was excited for him to be recruited and to be taking that next step and going to college.
'When [Harrison] was being recruited, [my husband and I] just told him that he had to make that decision and choose the school that would be the best path for him so I was fine with whatever decision his would have made,' Laura said. 'He made the decision that he thought was best for him and it turned out to be a really great thing.'
Now the Harrison is a Ute, he said what he really likes about the team is how much of a family it is. No matter who you are, where you are, or where you are from, when you join the Utah team, you are a part of the family, according to Harrison.
'Everyone has everyone’s back and everyone will do whatever we can to help another teammate,' Harrison said. 'That’s what it really is for me is how big of a family it is here.'
Because of how much of a family the football team is, it was one of the reasons why Harrison chose to play for Utah, but also said that another reason was because of how the coaches treated the players, adding that the coaches don’t see the players as a piece of meat playing for them.
'It is really just a kind of a respect thing and just being up here and seeing all of the guys and how much of a family it is,' Harrison said. 'That really what it is up here is a family and the respect from the coaches.'
After a two year break, Harrison and his team will take on BYU in the Rice-Eccles Stadium this Saturday, Sept. 10. Kickoff begins at 5:30 p.m.

Welcome to the Holy Warm-and-fuzzy. 
One of college football's nastiest rivalries (historically), it appears, has smoothed over its edges. It looks as though we might be in for a softer, gentler Holy War. Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham and his BYU counterpart and former protégé, Kalani Sitake, are exchanging pleasantries, not jabs, through the media. It's a fawning that would make the Mutual Admiration Society jealous. 
""I can say that I have a great relationship with Kalani,"" Whittingham said. ""We're the best of friends."" Kalani Sitake brings his alma mater to Rice-Eccles Stadium on Saturday to try to snap BYU's five-game skid against Utah and his longtime boss, Kyle Whittingham. Joe Camporeale/USA TODAY Sports 
Said Sitake: ""I know I love Kyle and Kyle loves me, and we're going to be friends no matter what. This is going to be one of those things that extends our friendship where we get on the football field and compete and we'll hug afterwards."" 
What? 
Love! Hugs! Best of friends! Way to mix it up, fellas. 
Where's the vitriol? Where's the bulletin board material? Where's Seni Fauonuku dropping ""D"" bombs . Where's Max Hall dropping ""H"" bombs ? Doesn't everyone (except in Oregon and New Jersey) pump their own gas now? 
The history of the rivalry, frankly, is too extensive to dive into with one column, though our Sam Strong did a nice job here . I could list 20 anecdotes about the rivalry through the years, and there would be at least 50 more that I'd be leaving out. 
One thing is for sure: The Holy War is beginning a new chapter. While Whittingham and former BYU coach Bronco Mendenhall were never outwardly disrespectful, they weren't going out of their way to be complimentary to each other, either. Whittingham never said the two were ""best of friends."" Because they weren't. 
And the fact is, Whittingham owned the rivalry with Mendenhall, going 7-3, including a current five-game winning streak. He put an exclamation point on it at last season's Las Vegas Bowl, when the Utes won 35-28 to send Mendenhall to his new job at Virginia with yet another loss to the Utes (how's that new gig working out, by the way?). 
Enter Sitake, who branched out on his own in 2015 and was the defensive coordinator at Oregon State before BYU snatched him up. And as Whittingham's coaching tree continues to grow and players from each school become coaches, the crossover between the two staffs will probably breed more admiration and less acrimony. 
Take this season, for example. There are four former BYU football players on the Utah coaching staff: Whittingham, Aaron Roderick, Justin Ena and Fred Whittingham. Heck, Kyle Whittingham was the WAC's 1981 Defensive Player of the Year for the Cougars. Ena was a three-time all-conference linebacker. And new Utah receivers coach Guy Holliday coached at BYU from 2013-2015. 
BYU has three former Utah assistants on its staff: Sitake, Ilaisa Tuiaki and Steve Kaufusi. 
Many of them are still good friends. Sitake and Whittingham golf in the offseason. They talk and text frequently ... though not this week ... because ... 
""This is one of those weeks where we want to respect their preparation,"" Sitake said. 
That might be the most anti-bulletin board quote of all time! 
Let's be clear, neither coach is saying he doesn't want to win. And if he can win by five touchdowns, all the better. There are still fan bases to appease. 
This isn't entirely uncharted territory. Former Utah coach Ron McBride and BYU counterpart LaVell Edwards shared a friendship and a strong mutual respect. 
""I don't see it as a big-time rivalry with hatred as a lot of others see it,"" Sitake said. ""It's a lot of fun, and it's exciting, and a lot of good people involved with both fan bases. 
""I'll never say anything bad about the University of Utah, about the athletic program and especially about the football team, because they were great to me, and I think that's important for me to share that with everyone."" 
In a Q&A with ESPN in February, Utah defensive coordinator Morgan Scalley praised Sitake, noting that he thought the rivalry had ""gotten a little bit nasty"" of late. 
""He's a guy I respect,"" Scalley said. ""I've coached underneath him, and he's always been there for me. I'm excited for him and his opportunity at BYU."" 
The fans might not feel the same way. Many have grown up choosing a side and bitterly defending their colors. And for that reason, friendships among the coaches probably won't sway those in the stands. 
""I don't know if that will have a major impact with the fan base,"" Whittingham said. ""I don't see that happening."" 
But on the field, it's possible, and one hopes, we'll see a more respectful game. 
""To me, that's what football is about,"" Sitake said. ""It's about respect. ... I think they'll play a much cleaner game.""

MICHELLE L. PRICE,9/8/2016 21:01,"
As Utah heavyweight Romney weighs in, Gary Johnson stumbles By Michelle L. Price , Associated Press | Posted Sep 8th, 2016 @ 3:01pm 0  
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Republican nominee Donald Trump leaves many in Utah cold despite the state's deep-red credentials, but voters eyeing third-party candidate Gary Johnson may be feeling some whiplash Thursday. 
The day after political heavyweight Mitt Romney name-dropped him on Twitter, the former New Mexico governor seemed to reveal a hole in his foreign-affairs knowledge when he was befuddled by an otherwise routine question about the Syrian city of Aleppo. 
Johnson, whose campaign is based in Salt Lake City, received national attention Thursday morning after he was asked on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" what he would do as president about the Syrian city at the center of the refugee crisis, Johnson replied, ""And what is Aleppo?"" 
Johnson later acknowledged the error, saying he ""blanked"" and had been thinking of an acronym, not the Syrian city. 
The interview came less than 24 hours after Mitt Romney, a high profile critic of Donald Trump, emerged from a relative silence on Twitter to say, ""I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall."" 
Chris Karpowitz, a political science professor at Brigham Young University, said it's unclear how much of an effect Romney's message and Johnson's misstep will have in Utah, where the overwhelmingly conservative state has given a relatively lukewarm response for Trump. 
Foreign policy isn't high on the priority for a lot of voters, but ""it certainly wasn't a great moment for Gary Johnson,"" Karpowitz said. 
Karpowitz said Romney is a respected voice in Utah but the tweet may not give Johnson much of a boost. It wasn't a full-throated endorsement and the election battle at this point is centered around Trump and Clinton and Romney has ""yielded the stage."" 
Romney, among the most high-profile Mormons in America, remains very popular in Utah, a state where more than 60 percent of residents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Jonathan Choate, a Johnson supporter from Logan, said he thinks Romney's tweet will encourage more Utah voters to give Johnson serious consideration, but he'd love to see a Romney endorsement. 
""I think it is the appropriate time for him to step up and make definitive statements rather than hints,"" Choate said. ""We're past the hinting stages."" 
Choate said Johnson's response to the Aleppo question might hurt him with Utah voters, but he thinks it was an understandable mistake because Johnson was asked the question without proper context about Syria. 
The misstep comes after another Johnson made this summer that linked Mormons to violence, Karpowitz noted. 
In an interview in July with the Washington Examiner, Johnson said he didn't support religious freedom exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, saying, ""Back to Mormonism. Why shouldn't somebody be able to shoot somebody else because their freedom of religion says that God has spoken to them and that they can shoot somebody dead."" 
His campaign later issued an apology in a statement calling the comment a ""very imprecise reference to the violence that accompanied the Mormon's early history in the 1800s.""

The woman on the other end of the phone spoke lightheartedly of spring and her 81st birthday the previous week. 'Who did you celebrate with, Beryl?' asked Alison, whose job was to offer a kind ear.
'No one, I …' And with that, Beryl’s cheer turned to despair.
Her voice began to quaver as she acknowledged that she had been alone at home not just on her birthday, but for days and days. The telephone conversation was the first time she had spoken in more than a week.
About 10,000 similar calls come in weekly to an unassuming office building in this seaside town at the northwest reaches of England, which houses The Silver Line Helpline, a 24-hour call centre for older adults seeking to fill a basic need: contact with other people.
Loneliness, which Emily Dickinson described as 'the Horror not to be surveyed,' is a quiet devastation. But in Britain, it is increasingly being viewed as something more: a serious public health issue deserving of public funds and national attention.
Working with local governments and the National Health Service, programs aimed at mitigating loneliness have sprung up in dozens of cities and towns. Even fire brigades have been trained to inspect homes not just for fire safety, but for signs of social isolation.
'There’s been an explosion of public awareness here, from local authorities to the Department of Health to the media,' said Paul Cann, chief executive of Age UK Oxfordshire and a founder of The Campaign to End Loneliness, a five-year-old group based in London. 'Loneliness has to be everybody’s business.'
Researchers have found mounting evidence linking loneliness to physical illness and to functional and cognitive decline. As a predictor of early death, loneliness eclipses obesity. 'The profound effects of loneliness on health and independence are a critical public health problem,' said Dr. Carla M. Perissinotto, a geriatrician at the University of California, San Francisco. 'It is no longer medically or ethically acceptable to ignore older adults who feel lonely and marginalized.'
In Britain and the United States, roughly one in three people older than 65 live alone, and in the United States, half of those older than 85 live alone. Studies in both countries show the prevalence of loneliness among people older than 60 ranging from 10 per cent to 46 per cent.
While the public, private and volunteer sectors in Britain are mobilizing to address loneliness, researchers are deepening their understanding of its biological underpinnings. In a paper published earlier this year in the journal Cell, neuroscientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology identified a region of the brain they believe generates feelings of loneliness. The region, known as the dorsal raphe nucleus, or DRN, is best known for its link to depression.
Kay M. Tye and her colleagues found that when mice were housed together, dopamine neurons in the DRN were relatively inactive. But after the mice were isolated for a short period, the activity in those neurons surged when those mice were reunited with other mice.
'This is the first time we’ve found a cellular substrate for this experience,' said Tye, an assistant professor at the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT and a senior author of the paper. 'And we saw the change after 24 hours of isolation.'
John T. Cacioppo, a professor of psychology at the University of Chicago and director of the university’s Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience, has been studying loneliness since the 1990s. He said loneliness is an aversive signal much like thirst, hunger or pain.
'Denying you feel lonely makes no more sense than denying you feel hunger,' he said. Yet, the very word 'lonely' carries a negative connotation, Cacioppo said, signalling social weakness, or an inability to stand on one’s own.
The unspoken stigma of loneliness is amply evident during calls to The Silver Line. Most people call asking for advice on, say, roasting a turkey. Many call more than once a day. One woman rings every hour to ask the time. Only rarely will someone speak frankly about loneliness.
Yet, the impulse to call in to services such as The Silver Line is a healthy one, Cacioppo said.
On a recent afternoon, Tracey, a Silver Line adviser, listened as a caller in his 80s embarked on a nostalgic trip down his list of favorite films. The next caller serenaded Tracey with 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning,' on his harmonica.
Once the harmonica player had hung up, a call came in from an 88-year-old man with an avalanche of memories to share: dogs he had owned, boats he had captained, London during the blitz. Tracey, a former nurse, listened patiently for 30 minutes. (To protect their privacy, Silver Line asked that advisers and callers be identified only by first name.)
'It can be really fascinating when people talk about things like London during the bombing,' she said after the call ended. 'It’s important to remember the rich lives people have led.'
Silver Line workers leave it up to the caller to mention whether they are feeling lonely. Still, the advisers are trained to listen for signs of unhappy isolation, and gently lead the conversation accordingly, perhaps offering to link the caller to a Silver Line Friend, a volunteer who makes weekly phone calls or writes letters to those who request it.
Sophie Andrews, chief executive of The Silver Line, said she was surprised by the explosion of calls shortly after the service began operating nearly three years ago. The Blackpool call centre now receives some 1,500 calls a day.
Andrews said she was most concerned not about those who called The Silver Line, but those who were too depressed by their isolation to pick up the phone. 'We need to raise awareness with the people who are the hardest to reach,' she said.
Cacioppo lauds efforts such as The Silver Line, yet he warns that the problem of loneliness is nuanced and the solutions not as obvious as they might seem. That is, a call-in line can help reduce feelings of loneliness temporarily, but is not likely to reduce levels of chronic loneliness.
In his research, Cacioppo has shown that loneliness affects several key bodily functions, at least in part through overstimulation of the body’s stress response. Chronic loneliness, his work has shown, is associated with increased levels of cortisol, a major stress hormone, as well as higher vascular resistance, which can raise blood pressure and decrease blood flow to vital organs.
Cacioppo’s research has also shown that the danger signals activated in the brain by loneliness affect the production of white blood cells; this can impair the immune system’s ability to fight infections.
It is only in the past several years that loneliness been examined through a medical, rather than psychological or sociological, lens. Perissinotto, the University of California, San Francisco geriatrician, decided to study loneliness when she began to sense there were factors affecting her patients’ health that she was missing.
Using data from a large national survey of older adults, in 2012 Perissinotto analyzed the relationship between self-reported loneliness and health outcomes in people older than 60. Of 1,604 participants in the study, 43 per cent reported feelings of loneliness, and these individuals had significantly higher rates of declining mobility, difficulty in performing routine daily activities, and death during six years of follow-up. The association of loneliness with mortality remained significant even after adjusting for age, economic status, depression and other common health problems.
Perissinotto is also interested in examining the link between loneliness and suicidal thoughts, as there has been little research in that area. She hopes to study The Friendship Line, a 24-hour, toll-free, loneliness call-in line run by the Institute on Aging in San Francisco that is also a suicide prevention hotline.
Although plenty of research into loneliness takes place in the United States, Britain remains well ahead in addressing the problem.
'In the U.S., there isn’t much recognition in terms of public health initiatives or the average person recognizing that loneliness has to do with health,' said Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a professor of psychology at Brigham Young University, whose studies also link loneliness to deteriorating health.
Age UK, an organization similar to AARP in the United States, oversees an array of programs aimed at decreasing loneliness and co-ordinates efforts with fire brigades to look for signs of loneliness and isolation in the homes they enter.
Another charity, Open Age, runs some 400 activities each week in Central London – sewing circles, current events discussions, book clubs and exercise and computer classes, held at church halls, sport centres, housing projects – and its employees also visit people in their homes to try to get them out and about.
'We try to work out what it is that’s preventing them from leaving the house,' Helen Leech, the organization’s director, said.
Men and women differ greatly in how they grapple with loneliness. Seventy per cent of the calls to The Silver Line are from women.
'We have this kind of male pride thing,' said Mike Jenn, 70, a retired charity worker who lives in London. 'We say, ‘I can look after myself. I don’t need to talk to anyone,’ and it’s a complete fallacy. Not communicating helps to kill us.'
Jenn runs a 'Men’s Shed' in London’s Camden Town district, which aims to bring older men together in a more familiar and comfortable environment – working side by side in a woodworking shop. The concept began in Australia and has since spread to Britain: There are now more than 300 Men’s Sheds throughout England, Scotland and Ireland.
Keith Pearshouse, 70, a retired school principal, discovered the Men’s Shed near his home after moving to London from Norfolk, England, in 2007 and recognizing he was lonely.
'I was a bit anxious walking into a roomful of people,' said Pearshouse, chatting amid the din created by a table saw, router and lathe at the Camden Town shed, a 700-square-foot workshop in a local community center. 'But I immediately thought, ‘Yeah, this is a place that would work for me.’'
Pearshouse, who had never worked with wood before he discovered the Men’s Shed, showed a visitor a delicate wooden jar he was finishing. His pieces are gratifying, he said, but not nearly as gratifying as the human connections he has made.
While Pearshouse is still a long way from sharing every little ache and upset with his friends at the shed, he said his life would now feel much emptier without the shoulder-to-shoulder way of confiding he has come to know. As he spoke, he took the lid off his jar, and it gave a slight pop, signifying a perfect fit.

stjoechannel.com,9/8/2016 21:06,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Utah football notes: Guy Holliday pushes aside personal feelings about BYU By KYLE GOON   4 minutes ago • Updated 4 minutes ago (Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Guy Holliday, University of Utah football receivers coach, runs through drills with players Saturday, March 26, 2016 at Rice-Eccles Stadium. Holliday, 50, is the only newcomer to Utah's football coaching staff this year and takes over a unit with less proven talent and experience as the Utes lose their top three receiving yard leaders and replace quarterback Travis Wilson. (Leah Hogsten | The Salt Lake Tribune) Guy Holliday, University of Utah football receivers coach, runs through drills with players Saturday, March 26, 2016 at Rice-Eccles Stadium. Holliday, 50, is the only newcomer to Utah's football coaching staff this year and takes over a unit with less proven talent and experience as the Utes lose their top three receiving yard leaders and replace quarterback Travis Wilson. Utah football notes » Former Cougar assistant would ather worry about the game than being a rivalry game topic   (6) It's not just another game for Guy Holliday, he readily admits. But the former BYU-turned-Utah receivers coach — and thus a new focal point for the rivalry — doesn't feel like it's personal. Yes, he left BYU in January to coach at Utah. Yes, he'll be across the sideline from a cadre of receivers he coached and recruited. It will be emotional, but he's pushing his personal business to the back of his mind, he said. ""I want to win the freaking game for the University of Utah, not for Guy Holliday,"" he said. ""I'm going out to win. I wasn't fired there. I don't hold any grudges. Man, I love Kalani [Sitake] like a family member. But at the end of the day, I want to win the game. I want to win for these players here, I want to win for Coach [Kyle Whittingham], and I want to win for our fans at the University of Utah."" VIDEOS TOP JOBS Holliday does have motivations to show well, and not just because he's facing his former employer. The Utes receivers coach said he was pleased with the progress of his receiving corps in the last game, led by a two-score effort from senior Tim Patrick. But Utah's whole offense has higher expectations for BYU, and he would like to see continued improvement from the unit that was considered the team's biggest question mark heading into fall. ""We're on track, but we're nowhere close to where we need to be,"" he said. Holliday's last game for BYU was against Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl, a solid resume for his hire the next month. The Cougars racked up 315 passing yards against the Utes after going down 35-0 to make the final result a one-score game. But there's a lot of new faces at BYU this year: Both Mitch Mathews and Devon Blackmon are gone. Nick Kurtz is still a starter, and junior college Jonah Trinnaman — whom Holliday helped recruit — plugged in opposite. While Whittingham said Holliday had some knowledge that he shared, Holliday himself said he didn't have all that much to say. ""This is a whole different offense that they're running,"" he said. ""If they asked me any personnel questions, you know, I gave my opinion. But not really. We haven't sat down in detail and talked. Everything they need to see is on tape."" The Utes themselves hope Holliday can continue to galvanize an area of the team that's been a weakness for the last few years. Both Tyrone Smith and Raelon Singleton caught multiple passes besides Patrick, but there's more to do. He'd rather worry about that than being at the center of the rivalry discussion on Saturday. ""There's some people who don't like me for coming here,"" he said. ""But at the end of the day, this is a business."" Pac-12 inks deal with Sling TV The Pac-12 conference announced Thursday it had done a deal with Sling TV that will air its six regional networks on the over-the-top service provider. The move gives an option to those who don't get the Pac-12 Network — most notably DirecTV subscribers — to receive the league's feeds as a part of the service's ""Sports Extra"" package. While the service costs, the deal figures to allow a workaround for the Pac-12 Networks, which has struggled for viewership since debuting four years ago. The deal also gives a workaround for another critique of the Networks, which is that it is too regionally focused. By giving access to all six regional channels, Sling TV viewers can pick and choose what they want to watch at their leisure. The league is in discussions with DirecTV, but not believed to be close to a distribution deal.

Polian: In 'perfect world' Pack not playing Notre Dame

The Wolf Pack has one big reason for playing at Notre Dame on Saturday.
Actually, make that one million big reasons.
That’s the number of dollars Nevada will get for facing the Fighting Irish, which is the third-largest single-game payout in school history behind a $1.5 million guarantee game at Texas A&M last season. The Wolf Pack also has a $1.3 million game scheduled at Northwestern to begin the 2017 season.
While getting $1 million to play at a historic location like Notre Dame Stadium is a great experience for his players, Wolf Pack coach Brian Polian said 'in a perfect world' Nevada wouldn’t play this game.
RENO GAZETTE JOURNAL
Pack's Polian returns to place that provided his big break
'No,' Polian said when asked if he’d want to play this game if not for the financial impact. 'When you look at a mid-major that has an incredibly historic year, one of those 11-1, 12-0 type years, when you look at their non-conference schedule they’re not playing two Powers 5s and if they are they’re catching them in a down year. In a perfect world, I don’t want to play two Power 5s every year.
'If we were supposed to win those games we’d be funded like a Power 5. If we were supposed to beat Pac-12 schools every year we’d be in the Pac-12. We’re not. We’re in the Mountain West. And then people judge you at the end of the year on your record and I don’t know if it’s fair to judge us compared to some other programs.'
The Wolf Pack, which is playing the fifth-easiest schedule among FBS teams this year based on opponent win-loss percentage from 2015, has played at least two schools from the highest level of college football in each of the last six seasons. The last time Nevada did not play two Power 5-level programs was 2010 when its two big opponents were Cal, from the Pac-12, and BYU, which was then in the MW.
Nevada faces two Power 5-level schools again this year in Notre Dame, which is an independent but grouped with the Power 5 schools, and Purdue, a Big 10 member that is 7-30 since 2013. The Wolf Pack has regularly played guarantee-money games over the last decade, with the cost of those games increasing in Nevada’s favor. When the Wolf Pack played at Notre Dame in 2009, it received just $650,000.
RENO GAZETTE JOURNAL
How the Wolf Pack has fared against Top 25 foes
'We need a guarantee game every year,' Polian said. 'We have to have it. It’s unfortunate that that’s the case. I look at some of the non-conference schedules in the league and some look like ours and some don’t. We have to have it for the financial well-being of not only football, but the athletic department, too.'
Polian, an assistant at Notre Dame from 2005-09, helped set up Saturday's game thanks to his connections in South Bend, although ultimately the call to approve games like this comes down to athletic director Doug Knuth. The Notre Dame game actually replaced a previously scheduled contest at Cal, but the game in South Bend offered a bigger payout, which is why it was scheduled.
'That doesn’t mean we don’t go try and win,' Polian said. 'That doesn’t meant that we’re afraid. But are we really on an even playing field? The reality of it, though, is the finances of mid-major college football and the finances of our university, in particular, dictate that we have to do this. Fans who believe we’re just doing this for football are mistaken.
'Half to maybe even a little more of this money that we get to play this game will go to the department. So the people who say, ‘Football is on their own island. They don’t support the department and other sports.’ We make a major contribution to the tune of well into the six figures.'

A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Ducks hold at No. 24 in latest AP Poll Ducks hold at No. 24 in latest AP Poll By Aaron Fentress September 06, 2016 11:22 AM 
The Oregon Ducks' 53-28 win over UC Davis on Saturday certainly didn't impress voters. 
Oregon remained at No. 24 in the latest AP Poll and fell one spot to No. 23 in the latest coaches poll . 
AP voters certainly love the Ducks' Pac-12 North Division rivals, Stanford and Washington. 
The Cardinal, which won 26-13 over Kansas State on Saturday, moved up one spot to No. 7. The Huskies, a 48-13 winner over Rutgers, jumped to No. 8 from No. 14. 
In the coaches poll, Stanford is No. 5 (up from No. 7) and Washington is No. 11 (up from No. 18). 
Oregon LB Troy Dye named Pac-12 defensive player of the week Oregon LB Troy Dye named Pac-12 defensive player of the week 
Oregon freshman linebacker Troy Dye has been named Pac-12 defensive player of the week . 
Dye had 11 tackles (seven solo) and 4 1/2 tackles for loss, including one sack, during the No. 24 Ducks' 53-28 win Saturday at home against UC Davis. 
Dye also blocked a field goal attempt. 
""I felt great about my performance but like I said before, there are little things I still need to work on to become a great player,"" Dye said. 
Colorado senior quarterback Sefo Liufau received offensive player of the week after he completed 23-of-33 passes for 318 yards and one touchdown. He also rushed for 66 yards on 14 carries. The Buffaloes won 44-7 over Colorado State on Friday night. 
The special teams award went to Utah sophomore punter Mitch Wishnowsky. He punted six times for 333 yards (55.5 average) during the team's 24-0 win over Southern Utah. Oregon freshman QB Herbert playing his role Oregon freshman QB Herbert playing his role By Aaron Fentress September 06, 2016 10:30 AM 
In a perfect world, Oregon freshman quarterback Justin Herbert would have seen more playing time during Saturday's 53-28 win over UC Davis at Autzen Stadium. 
A slow start by Oregon's offense, however, led to a late hook for starting quarterback Dakota Prukop. That resulted in Herbert not getting on the field until the final drive of the game. His lone play consisted of handing off the ball on a running play. 
Still, for the local kid from Sheldon High School, simply getting into the game proved to be a thrill. 
“It was really cool. Just glad to be out there,"" the 6-foot-6 Herbert said. ""It was a good win for the team. I was glad to be a part of it.” 
Herbert is in this position after beating out redshirt freshman Travis Jonsen and true freshman Terry Wilson Jr. to become Prukop's backup. 
Chances are, at some point Herbert will throw a meaningful pass this season. To that end, the Ducks' coaches would like to get him prepared as much as possible. 
“We were trying to get him in the game, get that over with,"" Yost said. ""Get that nervousness out as early as possible in case he’s needed that’s not the first time he sees the field."" 
Next up: A pass attempt. 
Herbert might have gotten a chance to show off his arm had he entered the game sooner. But the Aggies (0-1) kept the game closer than many expected, thus delaying Herbert's debut. 
Herbet said when he entered the game was of no concern him. He spent the game, he said, keeping track of what Prukop was doing and trying to learn. He still has so much to learn even after spending the summer cramming as much knowledge into his head as possible. 
“I really focused on the offense,"" Herbert said regarding his offseason preparation. ""Made sure I got that down, knew all the ins and outs of the offense so I could come in ready.” 
His ability to process information and then make plays impressed coaches and teammates during fall camp. Two weeks in it became apparent that he had earned the No. 2 position. 
“It was a little bit of a surprise,"" Herbert said. ""I came in and I just wanted to get the offense down and really focus on this as a learning year.” 
A couple of plays he made during camp led Herbert to believe that maybe he had a chance to compete for the job. But when asked on Monday if there had been a moment during camp when everything clicked, he said, not quite. 
“It was really tough and it was a lot of work,” Herbert said. “I think I’m still waiting for that moment. Still have a lot of work to do.” Prukop expects Ducks to improve greatly in Week 2 Prukop expects Ducks to improve greatly in Week 2 
The Oregon Ducks that were on display during Saturday's 53-28 win over UC Davis were nothing compared to what we could see this Saturday against Virginia. 
At least, that's the goal. 
“We’re expecting a huge jump from Week 1 to Week 2,” senior quarterback Dakota Prukop said on Monday. 
That improvement goal includes, of course, the play of the quarterback. Prukop, a transfer from Montana State, completed 21-of-30 passes for 271 yards and three touchdowns in his UO debut. But his performance lacked much flare. There were too many hiccups. Still, quarterback coach David Yost wasn't displeased. 
“Kind of happy with the first game,” Yost said of Prukop. “Pretty consistent throughout the whole game doing what he was supposed to do.” 
Maybe. But clearly one would expect an Oregon quarterback to be far more dynamic against a mediocre FCS program like UC Davis. 
Prukop said he was pleased with how the offense progressed during the game. The first quarter stunk, but the Ducks were humming by the fourth quarter when they racked up 182 yards of offense to reach 522 for the game. 
Missing was No. 24 Oregon's famed pace. Prukop blamed himself for taking time to get the offensive line into the proper protections after struggling to do so properly in the first quarter. 
Yost agreed. 
“We’ve got to constantly try to ratchet it up a bit,” Yost said. 
Growing pains should be expected with a new quarterback and several new offensive linemen. 
If the theory holds true that the biggest improvement is shown from game one to game two, a theory also endorsed by offensive line coach Steve Greatwood, then Virginia could be in trouble on Saturday. Oregon's offense must show improvement vs. Virginia Oregon's offense must show improvement vs. Virginia By Aaron Fentress September 05, 2016 10:15 AM 
It's somewhat unfair to criticize a team for winning a game by ""only"" 25 points, regardless of the opponent. 
Nevertheless, that's what happened with No. 24 Oregon following its 53-28 win Saturday over UC Davis, a Big Sky Conference team that went 2-9 in each of the past two seasons. 
The No. 24 Ducks simply didn't look like themselves, or, at least, the past versions of themselves. 
The players and coaches certainly shared that sentiment. UO wide receiver Darren Carrington II, who flexed his talent with seven receptions for 117 yards, said the offense's performance was just ""okay."" 
""We can't go anywhere lower than this,"" he said. ""I think we can only go up. I don't think we even did bad, or anything, I just think we can be a little more efficient on our drives and finish drives instead of leaving open drive and putting the defense back on the field."" 
In all fairness we're talking about just one game. The Ducks (1-0) could very well show great improvement Saturday night against Virginia (0-1) at home. UO's performance against the Aggies could end up being a meaningless blip on the radar screen of a long, successful season. Or, the team's performance on offense could be the sign of a developing trend that will result in defeats against better competition. 
Oregon gained 522 yards in the game, which isn't shabby. But the Ducks had just 340 at the end of the third quarter before tacking on 182 in the fourth. In years past against FCS competition, the Ducks would have reached the 500-yard mark and at have scored at least around 50 points by the end of the third quarter. Oregon led 39-21 at the end of three quarters on Saturday and finished the game with a modest 21 first downs. 
Keep in mind Saturday's game came against a lower-tier Big Sky team, not the likes of Eastern Washington, which won 45-42 at Washington State on Saturday, and last year lost at Oregon, 61-42. 
Take a look at Oregon's performances against FCS competition dating back to 2010. 
2015: Oregon 61, Eastern Washington 42 
Oregon gained 731 total yards and racked up 34 first downs. The Ducks rushed for 485 yards on 8.5 per carry and led 54-35 after three quarters. The defense, however, played poorly and that ended up foreshadowing the rest of the season. 
2014: Oregon 62, South Dakota 13 
The Ducks led 41-13 at halftime and 48-13 at the end of the third quarter. UO gained 673 total yards with 380 passing and 293 rushing on 7.7 per carry. 
2013: Oregon 66, Nicholls 3 
The Ducks led 38-3 at halftime and 45-3 at the end of the third quarter. Oregon finished with 32 first downs, 500 yards rushing and had 772 total yards. 
2012: Oregon 63, Tennessee Tech 14 
The Ducks led 35-7 at half and 56-14 at the end of three quarters. Oregon racked up 28 first downs while rushing for 324 yards and gaining 652 total yards on the day. 
2011: Oregon 56, Missouri State 7 
The Ducks led 56-7 at the end of three quarters before shutting things down and finished the day with 681 total yards with 416 rushing. 
2010: Oregon 69, Portland State 0 
The Ducks led by the eventual final score at the end of the third quarter. UO finished the day with 528 rushing yards and 668 total yards. 
--- 
Needless to say, the Ducks have been far more dominant against lesser competition in the past, as the above list illustrates. During that eight-year stretch the Ducks won three conference titles, two Rose Bowls and appeared in two national title games. 
Does this all mean that this year's team simply doesn't have what it takes to become a champion? Not necessarily. But it shows that the 2016 Ducks have a lot of work to do before it will strike fear into the hearts of opponents as recent UO teams certainly did.

Betting line: UO minus 24. 
Records: Oregon (1-0, 9-4 last season), Cavaliers (0-1, 4-8 last season). 
Coaches: Oregon's Mark Helfrich (34-8); Virginia's Bronco Mendenhall (99-44, 0-1 at Virginia. Went 98-43 at BYU from 2005 to 2015). 
Last week: Virginia Lost 37-20 at home to Richmond. 
Last season: The Cavaliers lost five games last season by seven points or less. But that couldn't save Mike London from losing his job after six seasons. Enter Mendenhall who promptly went out an lost to in-state Richmond, an FCS program. 
Cavaliers impact players: Junior quarterback Kurt Benkert , in his first year as a starter, looked solid in defeat, completing 26-of-34 passes for 264 yards and three touchdowns with one interception. 
Virginia's running game, however gained just 38 yards on 21 carries. Senior Albert Reid is the new starter. He rushed for 360 yards last season. 
Fear factor (five-point scale): 1. Virginia will bring much more talent into Autzen than UC Davis did but it won't be enough against what should be an improved Ducks team seeking to prepare for Nebraska the following week. If Oregon plays like it did Saturday against the Cornhuskers, the Ducks will lose. Virginia will provide Oregon with a chance to improve before facing real competition. 
Preliminary pick: Oregon, 47-20. Oregon LB Troy Dye lives up to the hype Oregon LB Troy Dye lives up to the hype By Aaron Fentress September 05, 2016 12:30 AM 
EUGENE - It took all of about three minutes into Oregon's 53-28 win Saturday over UC Davis for Ducks freshman linebacker Troy Dye to live up to the hype that surrounded him during fall camp. 
Two plays into his first college game Dye already had two tackles, including one for a three-yard loss in which he flew into the backfield off the edge to run down his prey. 
By the end of the first quarter, the 6-foot-4, 225-pound Dye already had six tackles with three for losses. He finished the day with 11 tackles, seven solo, with 4 1/2 tackles for loss. 
Keep in mind that last season Tyson Coleman led the team's linebackers with 12 tackles for loss. DeForest Buckner had 17. Dye is on pace for roughly 58 in 13 games. 
Certainly, that won't happen, but it does put Dye's performance in perspective. For those watching, the site of the ultra fast Dye tracking down ball-carriers was something to behold. To those on the team, it was just Dye being Dye. 
""How he played is how he's practiced every single day that he's been here,"" Oregon coach Mark Helfrich said. ""He's just been one of those guys that's electric."" 
""He's been doing this since the first day of fall camp,"" redshirt sophomore defensive end Jalen Jelks said. ""It's nothing new to us."" 
The college game is new to Dye but it certainly didn't seem like it. 
Dye, whose older brother played in the NFL and coached him in high school , said knowledge of the game helps him play fast. He enjoys studying the playbook and game film so he can go out and play fast and physical. 
""Sometimes I was out there and I knew what was coming. We watched a lot of film this past week and we dissected their offense really well. There were a lot of indicators and keys that they had so I just read 'em and went."" 
Where does Dye go from here? 
""He set a great benchmark for how he is going to play in the future,"" Helfrich said. 
Chances are he lives up to it. Dye is the type of linebacker Oregon has been craving, do-everything playmaker that opposing offenses will have to account for. 
That said, much tougher competition looms. UC Davis isn't exactly Washington or Stanford. But nobody on the team doubts Dye is only scratching the surface of his talents. 
""He's a very, very good athlete,"" UO defensive coordinator Brady Hoke said. ""I think his football instinct IQ is pretty good. I don't know if that absolutely surprised anybody But there's a ton of stuff that he can do better, too."" 
That's a frightening thought. Oregon's defense was scary bad against UC-Davis Oregon's defense was scary bad against UC-Davis By Dwight Jaynes September 04, 2016 7:19 AM 
Let's start off by saying that season-opening games are not necessarily indicative of what's to follow. Crazy things happen in the first game -- just ask Washington State, which followed up last season's home loss to Portland State with another defeat at the hands of Eastern Washington. 
That said, UC-Davis -- which lost 53-28 to Oregon Saturday afternoon -- is no Eastern Washington or Portland State. This was a team coming off back-to-back 2-9 seasons that has been picked by Big Sky coaches to finish 13th and last in the conference. And those guys passed for 303 yards against the Ducks, who forced just one turnover and got only three sacks. 
The Ducks even sputtered on offense against a team they should have put away by halftime. But I'm not going to overreact to the offensive fits and starts -- this team is two or three deep with offensive playmakers at the skill positions. Oregon will get its tempo down and be more efficient on offense with time. It better because at this point, it appears this team is going to need every point it can score. 
In fact, without the electrifying debut of true freshman linebacker Troy Dye, who had 11 tackles -- four and a half of them for loss -- this game could have been a serious disaster. Dye was all over the field in the first quarter and set a nice tone. But the Aggies left a lot of yards on the field, either by missing open receivers, not seeing them in the first place or by passes that should have been caught. 
It's probably not fair to ask that Oregon's defensive horror show from last season be fixed overnight, it's going to take some time. But Pac-12 offenses will steamroll what we saw Saturday afternoon out of of the Ducks. 
It was not a great day for the University of Oregon. The school's 17-season streak of sellouts -- 110 games -- came to an end, too. The crowd of 53,817 was just a few thousand short of capacity but sellout streaks are symbolic and a tool that sports franchises use to sell season tickets. And just because the opponent was from the Big Sky, that's not really an excuse. Eastern Washington drew more than 58,000 last season. 
If the interest level in the Ducks is down, what went on Saturday afternoon against UC-Davis isn't going to help much.

By Will Burchfield, @burchie_kid
In Jim Caldwell’s eyes, it’s pretty easy to grasp the special ability of Ziggy Ansah.
“All you do is take a look at the film – you look at practice film, even – and he does things that no one else does. He has some very unusual traits and characteristics,” Caldwell said.
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who’s been studying the Lions’ defense in preparation for Sunday’s game, would agree.
“They can obviously rush the passer, with Ansah especially. He’s a special, special player,” Luck said in a conference call on Wednesday.
Ansah, a relative unknown when he entered the NFL in 2013, has blossomed into a bonafide star. He finished third in the league last year with 14.5 sacks – just a half-sack shy of the Lions’ single season record – and was rewarded with a trip to the Pro Bowl.
“That’s quite an honor and that tells you right there that he’s one of the best in the league,” Caldwell said.
But the Lions’ coach still thinks the 27-year-old defensive end has room to improve.
“I certainly do, and I think you’ll see that. If he can stay healthy you’ll see an even better version of him because he’s really just starting to scratch the surface of all of the things that he’s capable of doing within the context of our scheme,” Caldwell said.
Ansah finds himself in rarefied air. He is soaring into superstardom, yet the sky remains the limit. He can still get better, even while being one of the best.
The NFL’s upper echelon of defensive players? That’s not really a target anymore.
“I like to think he’s already there,” said defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. “I think he just has to keep improving. I’m not looking for any numbers or anything like that.”
Ansah’s dad is, though. He’s pushing his son to break 15 sacks this season and write his name into the Lions’ record books.
Reminded of that on Thursday, Ansah smiled and downplayed the idea of aiming for certain statistics.
“Nobody ever puts numbers to the work that I do,” he said. “I just try to improve on the previous year and that’s the best I can do.”
In that case, one reporter pointed out, 15 sacks should be his minimum target.
“Thank you,” Ansah deadpanned, before breaking into a laugh. “Good job.”
Ansah’s ascent is startling given his background. The Ghana native didn’t begin playing football until his sophomore year at Brigham Young University and didn’t make much of an impact on the field until his senior year.
You’d hardly know that watching him now.
“He’s a guy that didn’t play from the time he was 8, 9, 10 years like a lot of guys, but he has all the necessary tools to be outstanding and he has a real nasty streak in him, which is something that I think makes a tremendous difference” said Caldwell.
The coach grinned when he mentioned Ansah’s viciousness on the gridiron.
“That’s the way you play the game and he does it well,” Caldwell said.
Austin went a step further.
“This guy is as fine a football player as I’ve been around,” he said.
Asked for his thoughts on receiving such praise, the poker-faced Ansah responded in typically subtle fashion.
“I appreciate you, Teryl,” he said.

Nathan Harker,9/8/2016 21:26,"
In a report by Yahoo Sports , the student government at Iowa State passed a resolution saying that it opposed the Big 12 potentially adding BYU to its conference.
The resolution said the reason BYU shouldn't be admitted to the Big 12 was because of ""discriminatory policies and practices (that) are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12.""
Th Iowa State student government issued this statement to the Ames Tribune: ""Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed. The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big 12 at this time.""
Here is a tweet with the ISU Student Body President's official statement.
In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0

Cassini probe discovers dunes and mountains on Titan by Brett Smith 
On a recent close flyby of Saturn’s moon Titan, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft was able to capture images of fine details on the moon’s surface. 
Among other things, the images revealed long straight dunes of what is thought to be hydrocarbon sand. These dunes were seen circling the majority of Titan’s equator. NASA scientists said studying the dunes can help them learn about winds, landscapes and the sands themselves. ""Dunes are dynamic features. They're deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,"" Jani Radebaugh , a Cassini radar team member from Brigham Young University, said in a news release .
The new Cassini images also showed a place previously dubbed the ""Xanadu annex"" by the Cassini radar team. Cassini's radar had not taken pictures of this region, but previous measurements by the spacecraft indicated the terrain might be quite comparable to the large area on Titan named Xanadu, the first feature to be identified on Titan. The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of Xanadu's outline in 1994. The annex region went undetected until the Cassini mission. Learning About Titan 
The new Cassini image showed the Xanadu annex is comprised of the same kind of mountainous terrains identified in Xanadu and dispersed across other areas of Titan. 
""This 'annex' looks quite similar to Xanadu using our radar, but there seems to be something different about the surface there that masks this similarity when observing at other wavelengths, as with Hubble,"" said Mike Janssen , a member of the Cassini radar team. ""It's an interesting puzzle."" 
Xanadu and its annex continue to be a bit of a mystery to NASA researchers. In other places on Titan, mountainous surfaces appear in small, separated patches, but Xanadu includes a large mountainous area. Scientists have proposed a range of theories on how it might have been created. 
""These mountainous areas appear to be the oldest terrains on Titan, probably remnants of the icy crust before it was covered by organic sediments from the atmosphere,"" said Rosaly Lopes , a Cassini radar team member. ""Hiking in these rugged landscapes would likely be similar to hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota."" 
Cassini has four remaining flybys left in its mission, and these passes will focus on the liquid lakes and seas in Titan's northern hemisphere. In April 2017, the probe will perform a series of 22 orbits that will send it between Saturn and its icy rings.

Below are our -- SportPundit -- predictions for WEEK 2 of NCAA Division I FBS College Football based primarily on our College Football Rankings Week 1 FBS 2016-2017 by SportPundit . We also look at the USA Today Sagarin College Football Ratings for 2016 , the Massey Ratings for 2016 NCAA I Football and the Dr. Kambour home field advantage calculations . The second week has a lot of matchups of FBS and FCS teams and top games are few.

Our system is based on net average yards per play stats, calibrated primarily by adjusting for schedule difficulty, i.e. the teams thus far played. Other adjustments are also made (*=adjustment). We take the cumulative yards per play stat data from cfbstats.com and from the college and university football athletic pages online. For the first weeks, we use last season's stats, unless a team has already shown a perceptible change in play this season.

Caveat emptor (Buyer beware): We make this material available in good fun out of interest for the sport of college football. Please do not rely on our material to place bets or wagers of any kind.  No one knows the exact outcome of a game or a season before it is played and that is what makes it so interesting. We disclaim any and all liability for the consequences of anyone relying in any way upon our postings, analysis, links or reasoning - for which we make no warranty of accuracy.

Red and blue recruits: Prospects feel rivalry intensity during recruiting process
I think it’s huge for both those two programs to try to, if they can, keep as much talent at home.
-Scout.com national recruiting analyst Greg Biggins
While the University of Utah and BYU football teams are preparing this week to face one another in Salt Lake City on Saturday, the game’s result in at least one way has been years in the making.
Similarly, work the coaching staffs are putting in now will have bearing on the outcomes of rivalry games in the future.
As yet another item on the list of ways the rivalry between the Utes and the Cougars is manifest, recruiting really never ends, meaning it’s part of the rivalry that doesn’t sleep.
Given the close proximity between the two schools, the strong influence of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on both campuses and the fact that the teams were in the same conference for many years, they’ve long engaged in battles for prospects.
Despite the fact that they’re no longer competing against one another for conference championships, those battles are still happening, particularly for in-state players.
Just last winter, a bevy of prospects waited until late in the recruiting process — some right up until February’s National Signing Day — to decide if they were going to go to BYU or Utah.
With the trend in recent years of top high school players leaving the Beehive State to play collegiately, there’s the desire on the part of coaches to convince top prospects to play locally.
'There’s always that battle to try to keep those top in-state kids home,' said Scout.com national recruiting analyst Greg Biggins. 'I think it’s huge for both those two programs to try to, if they can, keep as much talent at home.'
In somewhat of a strange sense, both the Utes and the Cougars have the same goal of keeping elite recruits in the state, yet it goes without saying they don’t want them to sign with the competition, said Biggins’ colleague at Scout, Blair Angulo, who focuses his work in the Mountain West region.
'You’re selling staying closer to home — that’s kind of a recruiting pitch you put out there — but at the same time, it’s like, ‘Don’t go to that place, come to this place,’' he said. 'It’s a plus and kind of a negative there where you kind of have to toe that line correctly.'
Now as another crop of prospects is trying to decide which school they’ll sign with in 2017, the rivalry is rolling on, as a number of players hold scholarship offers from both schools, in addition to multiple Power 5 programs outside of the state.
'I definitely hear stories from kids that both those two coaching staffs do a pretty good job as far as recruiting aggressively and hard,' Biggins said. 'I do see it as pretty competitive.'
The fact that Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham and BYU head man Kalani Sitake are close friends does make for an interesting dynamic in the ever-competitive recruiting process, although Whittingham this week downplayed it.
'Like always, you recruit against the university more so than a specific coach,' he said. 'We cross paths with a few kids in-state, but other than that, there’s not a lot of crossing paths.'
While the consensus among prospects is that coaches from the two programs focus on selling their program and don’t talk much about the other, fans are a different story.
Cottonwood’s Taniela Pututau , for example, said that many people in his LDS ward are Cougar fans and try to sway him to go to Provo, while his family consists largely of Ute fans since his brothers Howard and Fua are part of the program.
In the case of Ridgeline’s Levani Damuni , he doesn’t get too many in-person interactions with fans of the schools since he lives in Cache Valley (although Utah State fans do approach him about going there), but he does get comments on Twitter.
The social media site has changed recruiting from a number of different standpoints, including the fact that fans can easily tweet at prospects with messages both about 'their' school, as well as that school's rivals.
'I think every time someone’s tweeted at me like, ‘Come to Utah, come to BYU,’ it’s always been a positive thing,' Damuni said. 'I’ve seen it a lot where they’re talking down the other school, but it’s not really to me.'
Pututau had a similar experience when he tweeted a list of his top five schools in July, which includes both Utah and BYU (along with Oregon State, Navy and Colorado).
'A lot of people were wanting me to just follow my brothers and continue the legacy at Utah, and then other people told me to start my own at BYU,' he said. 'It was kind of annoying when I first put out my top five because I got all these BYU notifications and then Utah notifications. It was just kind of annoying, but it slowed down after.'
While Pututau said he tries to not put too much on Twitter to stir up fans, Layton’s Tayler Katoa has shown to be the opposite. Over the span of four days at the end of May, he posted a pro-Cougars tweet, followed up by a pro-Utes tweet.

 38 PM Providence’s Blake Proehl among sons of former NFL players on local high school rosters Providence High receiver Blake Proehl is the son of Carolina Panthers receivers coach Ricky Proehl, who played three seasons for Carolina.

Foster III dtfoster@charlotteobserver.com Providence High coach Brad Bowles during practice on Wednesday, September 7, 2016. David T. Foster III dtfoster@charlotteobserver.com 1 of 6   
Providence High senior wide receiver Blake Proehl said he doesn’t remember life without football. 
His father, Ricky, was a receiver in the NFL for 17 seasons, including three with the Carolina Panthers. Ricky’s now in his sixth season as Carolina’s receivers coach. Blake’s brother, Austin, is a junior wide receiver at North Carolina. While at Providence, Austin was All-Observer and played in the N.C.-S.C. Shrine Bowl. 
Watching his brother and his father closely, Blake said he knew early on he wanted to play football. 
“My dad and my brother helped me get better,” Proehl said. “My brother is a great route runner and there’s nobody like him. So everyday, I’m out in the yard working, trying to get better like him.” 
Blake Proehl, 17, is one of at least eight Mecklenburg County high school football players whose fathers played in the NFL. 
It’s a trend that began in Mecklenburg County not long after the Panthers’ first season in 1995. Former Panthers linebacker Carlton Bailey was once a coach at South Mecklenburg High, and that was news. 
Now, local youth football teams are chock-full of former pros who are coaching, like Hammer Down football’s Deems May (North Carolina, Seahawks, Chargers) and Clinton Portis (Washington, Broncos) with the Ballantyne Gators . 
Before he became an assistant coach with the Arizona Cardinals, Brentson Bucker (Clemson, Steelers, Bengals, 49ers, Panthers) coached youth football in the area, as did former Panthers safety Mike Minter, now Campbell University’s football coach. 
In high school last season, former All-Pro receiver Randy Moss’ son Thaddeus, a freshman at N.C. State, won a state championship at Mallard Creek. Former North Carolina star and Oakland Raiders tight end Ethan Horton had two sons play at Mallard Creek. 
Former Carolina Panthers defensive back Eugene Robinson’s son, Brandon, played at Charlotte Christian, where his father coached. Former Panthers defensive lineman Sean Gilbert’s son Zack, a freshman at Pittsburgh, played at South Mecklenburg. Sean Gilbert is an assistant coach at West Charlotte High. 
At Providence this season, Blake Proehl has caught 14 passes for 216 yards and five touchdowns. He also has a 91-yard kick return for a touchdown and averages 27 yards per kick return. 
He has committed to play college football at East Carolina. 
“They showed me the most love,” said Proehl, who also considered Appalachian State. “Coach Mo (ECU coach Scottie Montgomery) is awesome and that’s a football town (Greenville, N.C.). That’s a great place for me.”  ; 
At 6-foot-1 and 170 pounds, Proehl has been timed as fast as 4.49 seconds in the 40-yard dash. That was at a college combine in Boone last summer. A key player for Providence (0-3), he is considered a top-50 recruit in North Carolina. 
“He’s awesome and he’s dependable,” teammate Drake Deluliis, a 6-6, 220-pound tight end who committed to Virginia Tech, said of Proehl. “He’s kind of put aside his dad’s history and his brother’s history and he’s building his own history.” 
Said Providence co-captain and defensive back Caleb Bellamy: “He’s one of the best receivers I’ve seen all year. He’s quick off the ball, a great route runner, and he’s got great hands.” 
In practice Wednesday afternoon, Proehl displayed that speed and those hands, breezing past defenders and snatching balls that appeared too wide or too high for him to catch. Providence coach Brad Bowles marvels at the work ethic that allows Proehl to make those kind of plays. 
“I’m not sure he’s taken one day off since December,” Bowles said. “There’s a passion there that he’s got. He understands the ins and outs of the game and not just the on-field stuff. He understands what it takes to have a successful career, and he’s headed in the right direction.” 
Wertz: 704-358-5133; Twitter: @langstonwertzjr Sons of former NFL players 
At least eight high school players in Mecklenburg County have fathers who played in the NFL. And then there’s Hough quarterback Jackson Gibbs, the grandson of former Washington coach Joe Gibbs. Charlotte Catholic defensive back James Hurney is the son of former Carolina Panthers general manager Marty Hurney. 
Trey Bly, Soph., Myers Park (Dre Bly, Rams): Starter as a 5-7, 140-pound defensive back who averages 2.3 tackles for 3-0 Mustangs 
Tyus Fields, Soph., Hough (Mark Fields, Panthers): 5-10, 190-pound defensive back has Clemson scholarship offer, interest from LSU, N.C. State, Tennessee, South Carolina. 
Jeremiah Gray, Soph., Ardrey Kell (Derwin Gray, Panthers): 6-1, 185-pound sophomore defensive back has BYU offer, interest from Auburn, Yale, N.C. State, UNC, Virginia, Wake Forest 
Jordan King, Soph., Myers Park (Shawn King, Panthers): 6-2, 360-pounds, anchors the Mustangs’ defensive line. 
Tito Moss, Fr., South Mecklenburg (Randy Moss, Vikings): Freshman is the son of former NFL All-Pro and brother of Thaddeus, a freshman tight end/fullback at N.C. State. 
Muhsin Muhammad III, Fr., Providence Day (Muhsin Muhammad, Panthers): 6-0, 175-pound two-sport athlete. He'll also play basketball at Providence Day. 
Tim Newman Jr., Fr., Charlotte Country Day (Tim Newman, Jets): 5-9, 165-pounder is first freshman to start at running back at his school. He's run 29 times for 157 yards and two toucdowns in three games.

BIANCA BRITTON,9/8/2016 21:39,"Text written in ancient Greek
By: BIANCA BRITTON
Posted: Sep 08, 2016 09:00 AM PDT
Updated: Sep 08, 2016 09:00 AM PDT
More headlines
(CNN) - A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late ancient Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

How much of a role does the prestige of a college or university play in a student's career success? Brigham Young University professor of economics Eric Eide, lead author of a broad study of college graduates, explains that is has a lot to do with a student's major.

FIRST year university students are leaving their original chosen courses at a higher rate than ever. 
New data shows about one in five commencing bachelor students left their original course in 2014, and about 15 per cent dropped out completely. 
The figures also see the increase in the number of students not completing their chosen course climb to more than one million for the first time. 
Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, are defending the figures. They point out that while overall attrition rates are up, when it comes to the percentage of students dropping out of university completely in their first year (the adjusted attrition rate), the average figure is similar to past years, sticking at around 15 per cent for the past decade. 
But the number of students leaving their first year courses is increasing — whether they find another place for themselves in the higher education system or not. 
At the university with the worst attrition rate, the University of Tasmania, 42.26 per cent of first year students left their course during the first year, with most of those — 38.13 per cent of all first year students — dropped out of university altogether. 
The University of Melbourne had the lowest attrition rate at 7.5 per cent. Its adjusted rate — taking out students who had left their course but enrolled in another — was only 3.74 per cent. 
Universities Australia Deputy Chief Executive Catriona Jackson told news.com.au the attrition rates were no indictment on tertiary education providers. Rather, it was a “major achievement” that university access had been expanded to more Australians while keeping the dropout rate relatively stable. 
“Research suggests attrition rates are higher for mature age and part-time students — and if you think about it, they’re the ones who may often be juggling university study with jobs, children and caring for elderly parents,” she said. 
“Students battling disadvantage — including those who are first in their family to attend university — are also more likely to have thoughts about leaving.” 
The experiences of disadvantaged students highlighted the importance of student support programs run by universities, which help students to find the support and resources they need to complete their degree, Ms Jackson said. 
“The biggest factors for students who consider leaving university are often related to issues beyond university,” she said. 
“They cite pressures with their health or stress, juggling work/life balance, the need to do paid work, their overall workload and financial difficulties among the top reasons for doing so.” 
Grattan Institute higher education expert Andrew Norton told The Australian the attrition rates were worrying. 
“The question is: are universities actually informing students of the risks they are taking on, particularly studying online, and are they being responsible in taking on students who are at high risk of not completing?” 
The new data comes as the Federal Government awaits a report detailing recommendations about how best to make things clearer for students and keep them better informed. 
The Higher Education Standards Panel, which is currently reviewing submissions over university admissions, has acknowledged greater transparency for students is needed to reshape higher education.

However, the Cougars charged back and won the third set with an incredible lead of 21-2. This set proved to be shift of momentum as Buckeyes errors continued rampant and freshman McKenna Miller put away seven kills. BYU didn’t look back and won the next to sets and ultimately the tournament.
BYU defeated the Blackbirds in three quick sets (25-16, 25-8, 25-13) with Jones-Perry continuing to lead BYU with 14 kills and five digs. Cosy Burnett also put up 10 kills on a .667 clip while Mary Lake contributed 13 digs.
The BYU women’s volleyball team went 3-0 in the Sports Imports D.C. Koehl Classic tournament this weekend in Ohio to continue their undefeated record (6-0).
BYU was previously undefeated against Ohio State but this match proved to be a different story. The No. 11 Buckeyes pulled ahead early in the first set then won a tightly contested second set (26-24) as well.

Nicholas Coleman   3:58 pm 
As the college football season sets in, many can’t wait until the BYU Cougars arrive here at Rice-Eccles on Saturday. Across campus, MUSS members can be heard warming up their lungs and stocking fraternity houses in preparation for a weekend filled with festivity. Indeed, everyone on campus is anticipating the game infamously known as the “Holy War.” Following a rather tumultuous weekend filled with a handful of collegiate upsets, including the thorough annihilation of USC by the University of Alabama, coach Kyle Whittingham of Utah made a surprising announcement earlier this week. Citing his innate confidence that BYU will lose this year’s game, Whittingham has decided to remove modern equipment from his players, making a return to the classic leather uniforms worn throughout the early 1900’s. 
While this announcement came as a surprise to many, no other group suffered from greater disbelief than the NCAA — the regulatory body for collegiate athletics. Realizing that their preoccupation with stripping players of their rights had blinded them from establishing a rule against the retro-attire, the NCAA permitted Coach Whittingham to proceed. With secure legal footing, Whittingham has chosen to switch to leather padding for the coming weekend, and potentially even longer. Although BYU initially resisted, their honor code prevented them from verbally protesting, meaning the game will continue unabated. Thus, as this weekend starts to near, a certain deliverance of knowledge can be felt descending upon the entire student body. 
We must equip our players with the same gear as our ancestors from the early 20th century. 
In an attempt to normalize the situation, allow me explain the logic behind the idea. Between the period of 1898 to 1941, the U established an eighteen game winning streak against Brigham Young University. Indeed, the Utes domesticated the wild Cougars numerous times, all while wearing the tanned leather hides of cattle. The pads, filled with the thickest wool felt available in the early 1900’s, are easily attached to any section of the body. The cushioning is typically layered over stylish turtle necks, accented with red stitching along the seams of each shirt. While controversial, plastic helmets were developed around the late 1940’s, meaning they were likely inaccessible to the U during their winning streak. Seeing as it’s vital to keep all traditions intact, leather helmets will indeed be utilized for the game. 
Predictably, Whittingham received criticism on this point, especially from those who suggest that football causes “irreversible brain damage.” However, to say that Whittingham properly deflected these concerns would be an understatement. Citing former NFL executives and certified team doctors, Whittingham contended that concussions certainly don’t cause permanent brain damage to players. Rather, they teach young men that establishing manhood revolves around having your “bell rung,” a point that everyone can agree upon rather easily. Thus, the uniforms that the Utes will wear Sept. 10th will consist of the following: leather shoulder pads filled with wool, loose fitting padded pants, leather helmets with smaller holes to promote airflow, and wooden cleats. 
While this might seem a little superstitious, the Utes are reportedly feeling confident about the game, especially as they channel the strength of former players. Yet the implications of this game stretch beyond the scope of Saturday, as there is the added potential of employing these outfits for the matchup against USC on Sept. 23. Following an unbelievably rocky season opener versus the University of Alabama, USC’s status as a national contender is certainly being questioned. This, in the eyes of Whittingham, is an opportunity he seeks to capitalize upon. While acknowledging the Trojan’s gentility and class, an enduring characteristic of the team, the Utes hope to defeat their fellow PAC-12 rival handily. The leather padding employed during the 1900’s should indeed withstand the impact delivered by modern polycarbonate helmets, in addition to establishing the aforementioned manhood of players. 
While the decision regarding attire for Sept. 23 is undecided, contingent upon the results against BYU, those planning on attending the Sept. 10 game are encouraged to imitate former spectators. This can be accomplished through purchasing fine top hats and corsets for game day, in addition to an umbrella should any sunlight or rain emerge. Should everything go according to plan, however, the Utes should be able to reestablish their dominant forty-three year winning streak against BYU. Until then, get ready to spectate one of the most electric rivalries this side of the Mississippi River, and keep warming up those lungs.

Virginia head coach Bronco Mendenhall watches a play during the 2nd half of an NCAA football game Saturday Sept. 3, 2016, in Charlottesville, Va. Richmond defeated Virginia 37-20. (Photo/Andrew Shurtleff) Virginia’s Saturday night matchup with No. 24 Oregon marks the fourth straight season in which the Cavaliers are facing an opponent from the West Coast. As understood by first-year head coach Bronco Mendenhall, part of UVa’s strategy in scheduling such games was based in recruiting. The Wahoos could expand their footprint and become visible to prospective athletes in a land far, far away from Charlottesville. But when Virginia hired Mendenhall — and seven assistants — from BYU last December, the need for cross-country hikes lessened. There’s a staff in place now that has been exploring this territory for years. Mendenhall’s final recruiting class at BYU was mostly comprised of players from California, Hawaii, Washington and Utah. “And so with my staff coming from that area,” Mendenhall said, “those relationships [with high school coaches] are strong.” UVa’s 2017 class stands at 18. States represented resemble that of previous pledge groups — nine commitments from Virginia, two from Georgia, two from North Carolina, one from Delaware, one from Florida, one from Maryland, one from Ohio, one from Texas. “I don’t think we expected this at all,” said Cavalier running backs coach Mark Atuaia, a native Hawaiian and BYU assistant from 2013-15. “We were familiar with our posts out West. But when we got here, it became very, very clear: There’s a ton of talent just right down the road in Virginia. “So thinking of logistics and the other things that come with young men that have to adapt and avoid being homesick — those things come into play and affect their play — it makes sense for us to focus our attention here. And if there are kids that we know can make that transition from wherever we have relationships out west, then it makes sense and we’ll go forward with that, too.” According to 247Sports, UVa has offered scholarships to 11 prospects across time zones Pacific, Mountain and Hawaii–Aleutian this recruiting season. Wayne Taulapapa, a three-star running back from Honolulu previously committed to BYU, signed with the Cavaliers in February. He’s currently serving a two-year Mormon mission. “We’d be interested in any UVa fits wherever they’re from,” Mendenhall said. “Most of those are going to come from referral, even though we are having coaches visit California and Hawaii and some of the areas that we used to have.” Using the surrounding areas and adhering to the school’s unique restrictions, Mendenhall plucked enough skill to produce 99 wins over his 11 seasons with the Cougars. “When you talk about West Coast recruiting, the UCLAs, USCs, Arizona States, Arizonas, Oregons, they can offer any kid they want in the inner city of LA or northern California,” said Mike Farrell, national recruiting director for Rivals.com , “and BYU wasn’t able to do that. “So I think what [Mendenhall] did was he sort of mined diamonds, he found in-state kids that were good, he found California kids that were under-recruited, he went into places like Idaho and Oregon, where there wasn’t a ton of talent, and found players.” After Saturday, the Cavaliers next head west Sept. 23, 2017, to face Boise State. Starting in 2021 in Provo, they’re scheduled to play BYU three times in five seasons. Stanford, once on the 2017 and 2018 schedules, was replaced by Indiana two springs ago. “I would say that we will take and would be interested in University of Virginia fits no matter where they come from,” Mendenhall said. “The early report to me after being here the eight or nine months that I have been is there are enough players close that wouldn't warrant us spending extra time and resources.”

  Chicago Bears fullback Paul Lasike took a circuitous route to the NFL. 
Lasike, a native of Aukland, New Zealand and the ninth of 10 children in a Kiwi-Tongan family, enrolled at Brigham Young University on a rugby scholarship before making his college football debut for the Cougars in 2012. 
Four years later, Lasike is the starting fullback on the Bears’Week 1 roster. Last season, Lasike spent all but two weeks on Chicago’s practice squad, temporarily leaving the team early in the year to obtain an updated worker visa. 
“It’s unbelievable,” Lasike said Thursday. “I never would have envisioned myself several years ago looking down the road being here and being in this fortunate situation. It’s huge. At first, the toughest part was just learning the game. It was frustrating, because football is a very technical sport. You watch football from the outside and you just see people running the ball and catching, but there is so much more to it. There are so many things like timing, and the other nuances of football that I had to learn. That has been the hardest thing.” Bears fullback Paul Lasike didn't play football until suiting up for BYU in 2012. Fred Kfoury III/Icon Sportswire 
On Thursday, the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame announced that Lasike is one of 19 players on the 2017 Polynesian Pro Football Player of the Year Award Watch list. 
“I’m very proud of my heritage,” Lasike said. “We weren’t brought up too much in the culture, but there were certain things that my dad was brought up with -- work ethic and stuff like that. Even when I played in Arizona [the summer of 2015], and here. I’m pretty close to all the other Polynesian players, which is pretty cool.” 
Lasike might have a small edge. Former NFL center Kevin Mawae, whom the Bears recently hired to the coaching staff, is the inaugural member of the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame and one of eight voters for the award. 
“Oh, really?” Lasike said with a grin. “Yeah, I’ve talked to him for sure. He seems like a really good guy.” 
Among the other players on the watch list: Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota (Samoan), San Diego linebacker Manti Te'o (Samoan), Detroit defensive tackle Haloti Ngata (Tongan), Cincinnati linebacker Rey Maualuga (Samoan), and San Francisco defensive lineman DeForest Buckner (Samoan).

1,700-year-old obituary celebrates the charitable life of an Egyptian women who loved orphans An ancient obituary for a woman who died 1,700 years ago has finally been translated, revealing her name, faith and good character. The iPad-sized limestone epitaph is believed to have originated in Egypt, and has sat in a library in a university library collection in Utah since it was donated in 1989. --- According to Dr Lincoln Blumell, a researcher in ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, the inscription commemorates a woman called Helene. It pays respect to a woman who loved orphaned children and who died around the aged of 60. But what makes the memorial unique is the description of her faith. While the woman is identified as a Jew, she is given the title ‘Ama’, which experts say is almost exclusively reserved for Christians. ‘I’ve looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs, and there is nothing quite like this,’ said Dr Blumell. The full translated inscription reads: ‘In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. 'For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.’   5:20 PM | Permalink

WJ Cope,9/8/2016 22:22,"Brigham Young University is one of the few college football teams that still doesn’t belong to a conference. They have long been rumored to be joining the Big 12, and Iowa State has recently taken a stance against that prospect.
From Yahoo! Sports:
The student government passed a resolution 21-6 Wednesday night that disavows BYU’s candidacy on the basis that the school’s “discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12.”
The reasoning stems from BYU’s honor code. The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints school’s honor code bars “sexual relations” between members of the same sex and “all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings.”
One of the main reasons for this vote probably has something to do with the seeming lack of consequences for sexual assault accusations at BYU. From what I’ve seen in recent history, people who are raped at BYU tend to get punished more than their aggressor. That shit’s pretty fucked up, and it looks like this vote by the Iowa State student government is their way of sticking it to BYU.
Backward policies and questionable values are reason enough for the conference to be apprehensive, but there are plenty of other reasons not to want anything to do with BYU. One could bring up their stupid mascot, their location in the worst city in Utah (Provo), their dirty play on the field and basketball court, or basically anything else about them. What I’m saying is, Fuck BYU and everything they stand for..

Jupiter-like planet discovered in a distant star system (Phys.org)—A team of astronomers led by Alexis Smith of the German Aerospace Center's (DLR) Institute of Planetary Research in Berlin reports the detection of a Jupiter-like planet orbiting a distant subgiant star known as EPIC 212803289. The researchers also present compelling existence for the existence of a third body in the system, most likely a brown dwarf. The results were published Sept. 1 in a paper on arXiv.org. Rosetta catches dusty organics Rosetta's dust-analysing COSIMA (COmetary Secondary Ion Mass Analyser) instrument has made the first unambiguous detection of solid organic matter in the dust particles ejected by Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in the form of complex carbon-bearing molecules. Young magnetar likely the slowest pulsar ever detected Using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other X-ray observatories, astronomers have found evidence for what is likely one of the most extreme pulsars, or rotating neutron stars, ever detected. The source exhibits properties of a highly magnetized neutron star, or magnetar, yet its deduced spin period is thousands of times longer than any pulsar ever observed. Titan's dunes and other features emerge in new images New scenes from a frigid alien landscape are coming to light in recent radar images of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. A supercomputer models a blinking, impossibly bright 'monster pulsar' The central energy source of enigmatic pulsating Ultra Luminous X-ray sources (ULX) could be a neutron star according to numerical simulations performed by a research group led by Tomohisa Kawashima at the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ). NASA set to launch first asteroid dust-retrieval mission (Update) The US space agency counted down Thursday to its first mission to collect dust from an asteroid, the kind of cosmic body that may have delivered life-giving materials to Earth billions of years ago. NASA selects next generation spectrometer for SOFIA flying observatory A team from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, has been selected to develop a new, third-generation facility science instrument for the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, SOFIA. OSIRIS-REx mission will identify Bennu locations for collecting an asteroid sample An SUV-sized spacecraft, loaded with instruments and an extendable robotic arm, will soon be barreling toward a space rock, on a round-trip journey that promises to return an unprecedented souvenir: extraterrestrial soil, taken directly from an asteroid, that could hold clues to the very early universe. Small asteroid flies safely past Earth A small asteroid designated 2016 RB1 safely flew past Earth today at 10:20 a.m. PDT (1:20 p.m. EDT / 17:20 UTC) at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers, or just less than 1/10th the distance of Earth to the moon). Because the asteroid's orbit carried it below (or over) Earth's south pole, it did not pass within the orbits of communication or weather satellites. 2016 RB1 is estimated to be between 25 to 50 feet (7 and 16 meters) in diameter. It is the closest the space rock will come to Earth for at least the next half century. Asteroid mission will carry student X-ray experiment At 7:05 pm (EDT), Thursday, Sept. 8, NASA plans to launch a spacecraft to a near-Earth asteroid named Bennu. Among that spacecraft's five instruments is a student experiment that will use X-rays to help determine Bennu's surface composition.

An intriguing finding in nematode worms suggests that having a little bit of extra fat may help reduce the risk of developing some neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. Training human antibodies to protect against HIV During HIV infection, the virus mutates too rapidly for the immune system to combat, but some people produce antibodies that can recognize the virus even two years after infection. With an eye towards developing a vaccine, in four related papers from multiple groups publishing September 8 in Cell and Immunity, researchers describe a multi-step method for ""training"" the immune system to produce these antibodies in genetically engineered mice. Researchers harness antibody evolution on the path to an AIDS vaccine A series of new studies led by scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) describe a potential vaccination strategy to jump-start the selection and evolution of broadly effective antibodies to prevent HIV infection. The researchers plan to test this strategy in an upcoming human clinical trial. New 'Trojan horse' antibody strategy shows promise against all Ebola viruses In research published online today in Science, a team of scientists describe a new therapeutic strategy to target a hidden Achilles' heel shared by all known types of Ebola virus.

Teens are less likely to select sugary beverages that contain health warning labels Teens are more than 15 percent less likely to say they would purchase soft drinks and other sugary drinks that include health warning labels, according to a new study led by researchers at the Center for Health Incentives and Behavioral Economics in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. The study is among the first to examine how warning labels on sugary drinks influence teens, and builds upon research published by the team earlier this year which showed that parents were less likely to select sugary beverages for their kids when labels warning about the dangers of added sugar - which can contribute to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay - were present. The new study is published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine and has significant implications for policies being considered in several states and cities to require sugary drinks to display health warning labels. Marijuana use remains on the rise among US college students, but narcotic drug use declines College student marijuana use continues its nearly decade-long increase, according to the most recent national Monitoring the Future study. Telemedicine is as effective as in-person visits for children with asthma Allergists are the best-trained medical specialists to treat asthma, but not everyone lives close to an allergist. Children who live hundreds of miles from the nearest allergist may not be receiving the best and most cost-effective care. Prisons could unlock hep C-free future Prisons provide one of the most significant opportunities to drive down the prevalence of hepatitis C, and help reach global WHO elimination goals, says new research presented at the 5th International Symposium on Hepatitis Care in Substance Users today. Grass pollen allergy vaccine also effective against hepatitis B A new type of vaccine against grass pollen allergies (BM32) might also offer an effective treatment for combating hepatitis B infection. This is the finding of a study conducted at MedUni Vienna's Institute for Pathophysiology and Allergy Research that has now been published in the leading journal EBioMedicine, with a commentary from international experts. Excessive mental challenge can delay concussion recovery Just like the body needs time to rest and heal from an injury, the same is true for the brain. In fact, pushing the brain too quickly after a concussion can potentially delay healing, according to an expert at Baylor College of Medicine. Meditation plus medication could be the best medicine for migraines ""Effect of Different Meditation Types on Migraine Headache Medication Use,"" an article recently published in Behavioral Medicine, examines whether or not, and to what extent, a combination of spiritual meditation and migraine medication affects analgesic medication usage.

Study finds links between depression and risk of developing extremist ideas Depressive symptoms are associated with a higher risk of sympathies for violent protest and terrorism (SVPT), according to a study led by King's College London and Queen Mary University of London (QMUL). Cancer therapies for dogs may speed up treatments for humans In my favorite childhood photo, I'm sitting in a big laundry basket in a pile of lab mix puppies. They're licking my face, pulling on my curls and I'm laughing with absolute joy. Dogs are good at teaching us to live in the moment. But did you know they also inform us about diseases we have in common, like cancer? When a child stops speaking, researcher helps find their voice Eleven-year-old Aylani Suazo has not spoken to anyone in school since age 7. Seniors less likely to buy longevity insurance despite value, study finds As life expectancy for American seniors continues to rise, many aging Americans face problems outliving the amount of money they have saved for retirement. Annuities are one type of financial product that could help insure seniors never run out of money. Yet, despite their benefits, many older Americans do not buy annuities. The federal government has begun touting a new type of annuity, called longevity insurance, to try to increase the use of these products by seniors who could benefit from them. Now, a researcher at the University of Missouri has determined the types of people who are more likely to buy longevity insurance. This will help financial advisers identify these people as well as sell the products to those who would most benefit from them.

Small asteroid flies safely past Earth A small asteroid designated 2016 RB1 safely flew past Earth today at 10:20 a.m. PDT (1:20 p.m. EDT / 17:20 UTC) at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers, or just less than 1/10th the distance of Earth to the moon). Because the asteroid's orbit carried it below (or over) Earth's south pole, it did not pass within the orbits of communication or weather satellites. 2016 RB1 is estimated to be between 25 to 50 feet (7 and 16 meters) in diameter. It is the closest the space rock will come to Earth for at least the next half century.

Seniors less likely to buy longevity insurance despite value, study finds As life expectancy for American seniors continues to rise, many aging Americans face problems outliving the amount of money they have saved for retirement. Annuities are one type of financial product that could help insure seniors never run out of money. Yet, despite their benefits, many older Americans do not buy annuities. The federal government has begun touting a new type of annuity, called longevity insurance, to try to increase the use of these products by seniors who could benefit from them. Now, a researcher at the University of Missouri has determined the types of people who are more likely to buy longevity insurance. This will help financial advisers identify these people as well as sell the products to those who would most benefit from them.

www.fox16.com,9/8/2016 22:31,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

1,700-year-old obituary translated
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Just Getting This Outta the Way
Morning folks. Right, so, the App (OKAY NOT APPY OKAY FINE) State game: not the best! ""Pyrrhic"" might be underselling a game which resulted in Pro Football Focus asking what went wrong , The Ringer’s ‘Winners and Losers"" recap just declaring everyone a loser , and the Vols being variously called "" . Butch Jones is on someone’s hot seat list . Children-who-are-totally-not-adults-pretending-to-be-children are weeping:

There’s also this from CBS , buried halfway through Dennis Dodd’s comically-long weekly column:
Two-loss team in the CFP? With four teams in the top 11 losing in Week 1, perhaps this is a possibility. Essentially, LSU, Oklahoma, Tennessee Volunteers and Ole Miss have to win out to have a chance. While few were giving the Vols and Rebels a chance, when the Tigers and Sooners lost it marked the first time two top five teams were defeated in Week 1 since 1972.
...which is either some excellent low-key trolling, or what happens when you fire all your actual writers , we guess.
So not great! But luckily, there’s a game in two days. In the words of warrior-poet JRM:
Anything lost can be found again

Justin Fuente gave a predictably anodyne press conference yesterday, calling the Vols "" loaded across the board ,"" while The Key Play has a lengthy discussion of Bud Foster’s comments about the Vols .
The Hokies ran 89 plays last week, a blistering pace compared to the Beamer era, and are looking to run even faster this week . If you’re interested in what specifically to expect out of Fuente’s (deservedly) vaunted offense, SBN’s own Gobbler Country has a fantastic breakdown of their game against Liberty, building on their similarly great cutups/analysis series over the offseason, covering Fuente 101 , .
They also break down our Thursday game (spoiler alert: the line was dismal) and briefly ponder whether Dobbs will play Saturday (spoiler alert: he will). (Actually, doubling back for a second: Dave Hooker is dumb. ) MOVING ON.
Yo Dawg I Heard You Like Previews
As usual, Brad at B/R has a fine writeup previewing the Saturday’s game (with slides, though BOO HISS). Sporting News does one of those things with a bunch of numbers for section headers that are gasp actually vaguely relevant stats. Fox has a super-boring preview that predicts nothing, Chip Patterson at CBS picks VT to cover the 11.5 point spread , and Sportblog is calling an on-the-moneyline 27-17 Tennessee victory . Fun fact: both schools look to make more than four million dollars off the game , which interestingly is exactly $4m more than the players actually playing the game are expected to earn.
OTHER STUFF
Practice carries on, and Tuesday afternoon freshman wide receivers Marquez Callaway and Brandon Johnson both lost their helmet stripes .
Mike DeBord apparently agrees Kamara needs more touches . OCs, they’re just like us!
Tennessee President Joe DiPietro announced Tuesday the members of the new special commission to address sexual assault throughout the University of Tennessee system. The creation of the commission, which will begin by assessing the Title IX practices and procedures of all UT campuses, was announced in July following the $2.48 million settlement of the Title IX lawsuit.
In case you missed it, the Big 12 is having a sort of bizarre reality competition to decide who will next join the conference, and Memphis is evidently out as a candidate . Air Force, BYU, UCF, Cincinnati, Colorado State, UConn, Houston, Rice, South Florida, SMU and Tulane are the remaining schools being considered. I’m going to go ahead and say UCF is Chad.
The NFL, a boringly elaborate mechanism for producing fantasy football statistics, is wrapping up final roster cuts, and SI’s MMQG has a fascinating (and frankly really poignant) look at life on the roster bubble (really, read it, it’s good). Incidentally, GVX points out that Miami now leads the NFL in Vawlness , with five former Vols on roster (Arian Foster, Justin Hunter, Matt Darr, Dallas Thomas and Ja'Wuan James).
It’s STEALCONTENTFROMREDDITTHURSDAY
Actually, scrap that, we’re a battered fan base, we’re owning it. ""How worried should we be?"" Nah: what specifically are you most worried about in the Virginia Tech game? See? Progress!

Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
POSTED: 07:10 AM PDT Sep 08, 2016  UPDATED: 09:21 AM PDT Sep 08, 2016 
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

#ColinKaepernickSyllabus | New Black Man in Exile
On September 4, Rebecca Martinez tweeted Louis Moore and David J. Leonard, suggesting the creation of Colin Kaepernick Syllabus. Soon, we, along with  Bijan C. Bayne, Sarah J. Jackson, and many others began the work of creating a syllabus to hopefully elevate and empower the conversations that Colin Kaepernick started when he decided to sit down in protest during an August 26, 2016 preseason game.  
Building on the framework established by Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha Blain, with their monumental #CharlestonSyllabus, Marcia Chatelain with #FergusonSyllabus and subsequent efforts from Candice Benbow with #LemonadeSyllabus and others who have sought to not only use social media and online technology to crowdsource and aggregate conversations, this syllabus represents an effort to bring  together multiple conversations, histories, disciplines, discourses, and spaces.  If we are going to follow Colin Kaepernick’s lead to have conversations and work toward justice, we must do so with the necessary tools and collective understanding.  This requires engaging multiple conversations, entering into these spaces with a historic foundation, with knowledge about the persistent realities of racial injustice and inequality, with insight into the longstanding struggles of the Black athlete.  This syllabus represents an attempt to aid in these conversations, to turn our everyday conversations, debates, and discourse into a classroom, all while making sure our institutionalized classrooms are engaged with the histories, struggles, and public discourses that shape our current moment.  
Harry Edwards recently recently wrote, “silence is evil’s greatest and most consistently dependable ally.” For all those engaged in these conversations, for those who have written, spoke about, and organized around racial injustice, silence is antithetical to our work, our ethos.  Yet, too often people speak past one another; too many people presume because of the everyday saturation of sports culture, the ubiquity of media coverage of the Colin Kaepernick, and the hypervisibility (and invisibility) of racial discourse, along with the belief that this is all about opinions and “two sides” that they are prepared for these important conversations.   
Too often, especially within the media and from those whose whiteness - their privilege - insulates, empowers, and protects, people speak without the requisite tools, without the requisite historic foundation, and without necessary information. This offers a toolbox of knowledge, links to resources, and information. The #Kaepernick syllabus furthers the efforts to disrupt the silence, to make connections, and to otherwise build on the work of Kaepernick, Edwards, members of the WNBA, Bomani Jones, Serena Williams, and so many others demanding that we speak and act.  While continuing the conversation is important, it must be done so with literacy and knowledge about American racism, the history of sports, the African American athlete, #BLM, protests, and so much more.  Discussions aren’t inherently transformative but with the requisite understanding, introspection about privilege and widely-held assumptions, and critical examination, we are better equipped as we walk toward justice and radical transformation #KapernickSyllabus #WeSitWithKaep

Titan's Dunes and Other Features Emerge in New Images
New scenes from a frigid alien landscape are coming to light in recent radar images of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, from NASA's Cassini spacecraft.
Cassini obtained the views during a close flyby of Titan on July 25, when the spacecraft came as close as 607 miles (976 kilometers) from the giant moon. The spacecraft's radar instrument is able to penetrate the dense, global haze that surrounds Titan, to reveal fine details on the surface.
One of the new views (along with a short video) shows long, linear dunes, thought to be comprised of grains derived from hydrocarbons that have settled out of Titan's atmosphere. Cassini has shown that dunes of this sort encircle most of Titan's equator. Scientists can use the dunes to learn about winds, the sands they're composed of, and highs and lows in the landscape.
""Dunes are dynamic features. They're deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,"" said Jani Radebaugh, a Cassini radar team associate at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.
Another new image shows an area nicknamed the ""Xanadu annex"" earlier in the mission by members of the Cassini radar team. Cassini's radar had not previously obtained images of this area, but earlier measurements by the spacecraft suggested the terrain might be quite similar to the large region on Titan named Xanadu.

Iowa State against BYU addition into Big 12 Caleb Bailey 
The BYU Cougars are one of the frontrunners to be added into the Big 12 conference when they expand in the coming months. However, it doesn’t seem like one member school is excited to welcome the team in. 
The Iowa State student senate released a statement disapproving of BYU’s inclusion into the conference. They claimed that the school’s Student Code of Conduct does not reflect the values of the Big 12. 
The senate joined more than two dozen other LGBTQ advocacy groups that wrote a letter to Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby and the league’s school presidents that criticize BYU’s code of conduct, which prohibits “homosexual behavior.” 
“Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed. The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents . Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time,” the student senate said in a released statement. 
BYU is well-known for its Mormon founding and values, so it shouldn’t come as a surprise the school frowns upon same-sex relations. It will certainly be interesting to see how the Cougars react to this statement from a school that could very well be in playing alongside them in the near future.

More than 1,200 volunteers rendered service Thursday across Utah County in conjunction with United Way’s Day of Caring. 
The Day of Caring is an annual, national event centered on serving the needy in communities across the country. 
Traditionally, the Day of Caring in Utah County focuses on service projects primarily in Provo and Orem. But this year, volunteers served in all corners of the valley. 
“What I loved about this is we had several sites that were further out in the county. We went to a few homes in Payson and a few places in Eagle Mountain,” said Michaelann Bradley, communications manager for United Way of Utah County. 
While some heaved heavy sighs at the thought of driving farther to the smaller communities, Bradley said it was a great opportunity to leave impressions around the county. 
“There was a principal in Eagle Mountain who commented for kids to see these professionals who are engaged in the community is so critical,” Bradley said. “They just loved seeing them working in their schools.” 
United Way has three key pillars of its service projects — education, health and shelter. 
RaDene Hatfield, a member of Women United, was just one of the thousands volunteering Thursday. She and a group of other volunteers have gathered more than 2,000 books to be delivered to first and second graders throughout Utah County. 
“We’re trying to encourage kids to read at home and part of that is to have grade- and age-level-appropriate books,” Hatfield said. 
Women United has an organizational goal of bringing the literacy level of Utah County third-graders from its current rating of 75 percent to 90 percent by 2020. 
“(Reading ability) is very strongly correlated with many social needs — graduation, crime and even teenage pregnancy,” she said. 
Joe Hadfield, director of online communications at Brigham Young University, led a team of about 50 people at the Community Action Services site in Provo. There, volunteers installed sprinklers, power-washed the building and landscaped much of the grounds. 
Hadfield said he and the volunteers enjoyed getting to know each other better while doing something good. 
“It was really neat to make connections just here at BYU and learn about the people who make BYU tick,” he said. “In the process, it’s fun to make friends as you’re doing something for the community.” 
For those who want to volunteer in the county, Bradley said they can visit volunteer.unitedway.org . There, lists of service opportunities are available for those seeking to lend a helping hand. Alternatively, call 211, which will automatically redirect to United Way and agents can help interested individuals find service opportunities. 
Bradley hopes those who participated in the Day of Caring continue to feel the spirit of volunteerism to reach out independently to those in their community. 
“There are people in your neighborhoods. You don’t need someone to organize service projects for you,” she said. “Don’t just wait, just do it.”

funeraldotcom,9/8/2016 23:02,"Donald Sidney Latimer, age 86, passed away peacefully on September 6, 2016 in the Ashford Assisted Living Center, Springville, Utah. He was born May 6, 1930, in San Francisco, California to Charles Sidney Latimer and Eva Louise Earnshaw. Don moved with his family to Salt Lake City, Utah in May of 1941. The family eventually settled in a section of Sandy, later renamed Midvale, where he attended Jordan High School. After graduating in the class of 1947, as a state honorable mention for football, he began studying at Brigham Young University in the fall. In the spring of 1949, Don enlisted in the National Guard and his 145th Field Artillery battalion was activated as a result of the Korean War. He entered full service on September 3, 1950 and, after training, was deployed on October of 1951. He spent the following year in Korea where he earned the Korean and United Nations service medals. He was honorably discharged on August 13, 1952. The Sunday after his return, Don was called by his bishop to serve a two-year mission in western Canada for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, reporting to the mission home three weeks later. Following his mission, he continued playing on the offensive line for the BYU football team as he continued his studies. He received a BS in Business Management in 1957. Don was married to Carla Kaye Benson on April 30, 1959 and moved to California to raise their family. They are the parents of five children: Chad (Cindy), Marc (Maria), Rex (deceased), DeeDee Day (Josh), and Troy (Amanda); and are the grandparents to 17 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Don returned to Utah and married Marva Edwards of Orem, Utah, on November 6, 1998. They have been a devoted couple the last 18 years of his life, vacationing, attending BYU religion classes and attending all BYU home football games. Marva was the angel Don needed to serve and take care of him during the final years of his life. Don is survived by his brothers Kenneth and Richard, and is now reunited with his mother and father, and his sister Evelyn and son Rex, who had passed away on June 9, 1972 and January 4, 1997, respectively. Don was dedicated to church service and was an avid learner. He read two papers daily, kept up on new business trends and immersed himself in literature and scripture to continually feed his lifelong quest to understand the foundation and principles of his faith. Funeral services will be held at 11:00 a.m., Friday, September 9, 2016 in the Dry Creek 2nd Ward Chapel, 355 E. Center Street, Springville, Utah. A viewing will be held at the Berg Mortuary of Provo, 185 Center Street, on Thursday, September 8, from 6-8:00 p.m. and at the church Friday, from 9:30-10:30 a.m. prior to services. Interment services will be held at the Utah Veteran’s Cemetery and Memorial Park. Condolences may be expressed at www.bergmortuary.com.

Bryan Fischer,9/8/2016 23:05,"Another week, another twist in the drama surrounding Big 12 expansion.
The latest move was made Wednesday night on the subject from an unlikely source: Iowa State's student government, which passed a resolution opposing BYU joining the Big 12 Conference.
“Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed,"" the group said in an official statement obtained by the Ames Tribune. ""The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.”
The resolution will reportedly be sent to the presidents all every Big 12 school in addition to conference commissioner Bob Bowlsby.
BYU's honor code has been one of the chief sticking points surrounding the school's candidacy to join the Big 12 and a subject that has received quite a bit of attention ever since the league announced it was looking at expansion. The school, which is privately owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has been criticized heavily over the years regarding sections of the code that prohibits homosexual behavior, among other things. National LGBT advocacy groups have already sent letters to the Big 12 conference office urging them to avoid inviting the Cougars because of the school's stances but Wednesday's resolution by ISU's student government appears to be the first -- and so far loudest -- message made against BYU by one of the conference's current members.
Big 12 leaders are reportedly meeting with school officials from a group of roughly 10 finalists this week in Dallas. While it has not been made public when BYU will present their case, it appears likely that the thorny issue surrounding the honor code will play a key role as to whether the Cougars are ultimately invited to join the conference or if they will remain an independent school in football.
It's doubtful that a student government resolution would be enough to truly derail the otherwise strong case BYU has to join the Big 12 but, given all of the twists and turns that have already happened with conference expansion, stranger things have happened.

Titan's Dunes and Other Features Emerge in New Images
Sep 8, 2016
This synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) image was obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft on July 25, 2016, during its ""T-121"" pass over Titan's southern latitudes. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASI/Université Paris-Diderot
New scenes from a frigid alien landscape are coming to light in recent radar images of Saturn's largest moon, Titan , from NASA's Cassini spacecraft.
Cassini obtained the views during a close flyby of Titan on July 25, when the spacecraft came as close as 607 miles (976 kilometers) from the giant moon. The spacecraft's radar instrument is able to penetrate the dense, global haze that surrounds Titan, to reveal fine details on the surface.
Hundreds of sand dunes are visible as dark lines snaking across the surface. Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASI/Université Paris-Diderot
One of the new views shows long, linear dunes, thought to be comprised of grains derived from hydrocarbons that have settled out of Titan's atmosphere. Cassini has shown that dunes of this sort encircle most of Titan's equator. Scientists can use the dunes to learn about winds, the sands they're composed of, and highs and lows in the landscape.
""Dunes are dynamic features. They're deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,"" said Jani Radebaugh, a Cassini radar team associate at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.
Another new image shows an area nicknamed the ""Xanadu annex"" earlier in the mission by members of the Cassini radar team. Cassini's radar had not previously obtained images of this area, but earlier measurements by the spacecraft suggested the terrain might be quite similar to the large region on Titan named Xanadu.
First imaged in 1994 by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, Xanadu was the first surface feature to be recognized on Titan. While Hubble was able to see Xanadu's outline, the annex area went unnoticed.
The new Cassini image reveals that the Xanadu annex is, indeed, made up of the same type of mountainous terrains observed in Xanadu and scattered across other parts of Titan.
""This 'annex' looks quite similar to Xanadu using our radar, but there seems to be something different about the surface there that masks this similarity when observing at other wavelengths, as with Hubble,"" said Mike Janssen, also a JPL member of the radar team. ""It's an interesting puzzle.""
Xanadu - and now its annex - remains something of a mystery. Elsewhere on Titan, mountainous terrain appears in small, isolated patches, but Xanadu covers a large area, and scientists have proposed a variety of theories about its formation.
""These mountainous areas appear to be the oldest terrains on Titan, probably remnants of the icy crust before it was covered by organic sediments from the atmosphere,"" said Rosaly Lopes, a Cassini radar team member at JPL. ""Hiking in these rugged landscapes would likely be similar to hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota.""
The July 25 flyby was Cassini's 122nd encounter with Titan since the spacecraft's arrival in the Saturn system in mid-2004. It was also the last time Cassini's radar will image terrain in the far southern latitudes of Titan.
""If Cassini were orbiting Earth instead of Saturn, this would be like getting our last close view of Australia,"" said Stephen Wall, deputy lead of the Cassini radar team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
Cassini's four remaining Titan flybys will focus primarily on the liquid-filled lakes and seas in Titan's far north. The mission will begin its finale in April 2017, with a series of 22 orbits that plunge between the planet and its icy rings.

drivendeep,9/8/2016 23:23,"Life is a journey for sure! It has its ups and downs; it's detours and destinations; its back roads and its highways. 
Life can be tough, life can teach you patience whether you want to learn or not. But oh how glorious life can be as well! Life is the most precious gift I have ever received. The ability to live however I choose, is a gift I will be eternally grateful for.
It's interesting to me though, how even with exact circumstances two people can have very different outlooks on life. One may see it as a burden, but another may see it as the greatest of joys. What's the difference between these two people? 
Plain and simple, when you think, speak, and act negative the world will be an awful place. But when you think, speak, and act positive the world will be a wonderful place. It's as simple as that. So start today... Be positive and choose to be happy no matter what!
Choose to make this life a daring adventure! And as you choose to be happy over an extended period of time, you will have less stress, less depression and anxiety, you will be more social for you will see more quickly the good in others. You will not be so easily angered, and you will see more easily the tender mercies God showers upon you. 
To those within the sound of my voice... Life is the greatest most daring adventure I have ever taken! 
Take care everyone and have a great night. 😊

ABQJournal News Staff,9/8/2016 23:30,"
By ABQJournal News Staff  30pm Kim Reeder has joined the University of New Mexico softball coaching the staff, the school announced on Sept. 8, 2016. (UNM photo) 
Kim Reeder, a former All-America pitcher at Ohio State and a coach the last two years with the Central Coast Girls Athletic Foundation, has joined the University of New Mexico softball staff as an assistant coach. 
“Kim is going to an instrumental part of our staff,” said UNM head coach Erica Beach. “She brings a wealth of knowledge and an incredible passion for the game. She is a dynamic coach, who makes every player better and I am so happy to have her as part of the Lobo family.” 
Reeder replaces Jessica Garcia, who is leaving the program to attend graduate school. 
Beach was coaching at Ohio State when Reeder played there (2005-09). Reeder, who has been a pitching instructor for over 10 years, will come into the program to help out with the Lobo pitchers which will allow Beach to expand her responsibilities within the team. She has helped pitchers get to many colleges at the next level, including Santa Clara, BYU, Slippery Rock, Washington Mount Vernon Nazarene and New Mexico. 
Reeder not only has a significant coaching background, but she is very well rounded in the recruiting area. Along with coaching duties at Central Coast Athletics, she was the recruiting coordinator and liaison sending players to Division I colleges, including Portland State, UNM, Western Washington, Sacramento State and Santa Clara in the last year. 
Reeder spent two seasons in professional softball, playing overseas in the Italian Softball League. In 222 innings of work in the circle, she had a 1.26 earned run average. Advertisement

Prestigious College or Major: Which Pays off More?
National
University attrition rates: Why are so many students dropping out?
Liz Burke, news.com.au
September 9, 2016 7:48am
FIRST year university students are leaving their original chosen courses at a higher rate than ever.
New data shows about one in five commencing bachelor students left their original course in 2014, and about 15 per cent dropped out completely.
The figures also see the increase in the number of students not completing their chosen course climb to more than one million for the first time.
Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, are defending the figures. They point out that while overall attrition rates are up, when it comes to the percentage of students dropping out of university completely in their first year (the adjusted attrition rate), the average figure is similar to past years, sticking at around 15 per cent for the past decade.
But the number of students leaving their first year courses is increasing — whether they find another place for themselves in the higher education system or not.
At the university with the worst attrition rate, the University of Tasmania, 42.26 per cent of first year students left their course during the first year, with most of those — 38.13 per cent of all first year students — dropped out of university altogether.
The University of Melbourne had the lowest attrition rate at 7.5 per cent. Its adjusted rate — taking out students who had left their course but enrolled in another — was only 3.74 per cent.
Universities Australia Deputy Chief Executive Catriona Jackson told news.com.au the attrition rates were no indictment on tertiary education providers. Rather, it was a “major achievement” that university access had been expanded to more Australians while keeping the dropout rate relatively stable.
“Research suggests attrition rates are higher for mature age and part-time students — and if you think about it, they’re the ones who may often be juggling university study with jobs, children and caring for elderly parents,” she said.
“Students battling disadvantage — including those who are first in their family to attend university — are also more likely to have thoughts about leaving.”
The experiences of disadvantaged students highlighted the importance of student support programs run by universities, which help students to find the support and resources they need to complete their degree, Ms Jackson said.
“The biggest factors for students who consider leaving university are often related to issues beyond university,” she said.
“They cite pressures with their health or stress, juggling work/life balance, the need to do paid work, their overall workload and financial difficulties among the top reasons for doing so.”
Grattan Institute higher education expert Andrew Norton told The Australian the attrition rates were worrying.
“The question is: are universities actually informing students of the risks they are taking on, particularly studying online, and are they being responsible in taking on students who are at high risk of not completing?”
The new data comes as the Federal Government awaits a report detailing recommendations about how best to make things clearer for students and keep them better informed.
The Higher Education Standards Panel, which is currently reviewing submissions over university admissions, has acknowledged greater transparency for students is needed to reshape higher education.

1,700-year-old obituary translated
By Bianca Britton for CNN

(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Eye on the Election 2016
Meet South Orange County’s CUSD Candidates
By Allison Jarrell
Six candidates are running for three seats on the Capistrano Unified School District’s Board of Trustees in Areas 1, 2 and 3, which cover schools in South Orange County. Each area has two candidates vying for a seat, and in Area 3, both candidates are newcomers, as incumbent John Alpay is running for a seat on the South Orange County Community College District Board of Trustees.
There is also a fourth seat up for election in Trustee Area 5, which covers schools in Aliso Viejo and Laguna Niguel. Incumbent Gary Pritchard is running against three candidates: Jorge Velastegui, Monica Maddox and Jake Vollebregt.
The San Clemente Times asked the six candidates running in Areas 1, 2 and 3 to submit a statement on who they are and why they’re running for a seat on the CUSD Board of Trustees. Candidates’ responses are listed below in the same order that they’ll appear on the Nov. 8 general election ballot.
Additionally, the CUSD Board of Trustees voted in August to call a school bond election within the newly formed School Facilities Improvement District #2, which encompasses the entire district except for Rancho Mission Viejo. If 55 percent of voters approve the $889 million general obligation bond measure on Nov. 8, residents living within SFID #2 will be taxed $43 for every $100,000 of assessed value on their homes to help the district leverage state funds to pay for over $800 million in deferred facilities maintenance. For a complete rundown of the district’s bond measure, visit www.sanclementetimes.com .

Wendy Shrove, Software Development Business Owner
Wendy Shrove
My husband, Richard, and I moved to San Clemente 20 years ago. We are grateful to call South Orange County home. We have two children who both attend CUSD schools. We are continually impressed by the commitment of parents and businesses supporting our schools.
I am running for CUSD Trustee because we need better leadership and representation on our school board. Too many feel we don't have 'a seat at the CUSD table.' Residents feel unheard and unrepresented. We can change this. Let's get away from the 'top-down' approach and start engaging our communities.
Working alongside our educators, we can make the quality of local education match the quality of our communities. More students need the opportunity to stretch their abilities in advanced courses. We have too many students below minimum standards in English and math. Our occupational training programs should match skills needed in the current job market. We can meet these challenges because we are engaged in our children’s education.
I don’t support Measure M, the $889 million bond. We cannot commit to unnecessary debt and expect our children to repay it. Our school board must be a better steward of our tax dollars and earn community trust. I will insist on clear, detailed reporting of spending and look for reasonable ways to save money and redirect funds back to our kids. No family should be asked to subsidize the school district unless all other means of funding have been explored.
I have been a small business owner for 20 years, specializing in software development. I design solutions to complex problems within tight budgets. On behalf of students, taxpayers and educators, I will apply my skills and experience for solutions to issues facing CUSD.
Now is the time to elect better leadership on the CUSD Board.

Amy Hanacek, Incumbent
Amy Hanacek
As an involved parent of two CUSD graduates, I witnessed firsthand what our Founding Fathers knew: public education is essential to our country's common good. During my time on the board, we have experienced rapid growth in science, technology, engineering, arts and math, and have expanded school of choice opportunities. My personal mission remains focused on the needs of all students and creating productive citizens through high-quality education.
As a longtime resident of Capistrano Beach and retired small business owner, I am keenly aware of the positive impact successful local schools have on property values and how they maintain the vitality of our communities. My commitment as School Board Trustee is to enhance the academic strength and quality of Capistrano Unified School District schools and to reinforce the direct correlation between strong, healthy schools and vibrant, safe communities, protecting our investments in our homes and in our neighborhoods.
I utilize my background as a small business owner and experienced board member to practice fiscal prudence while working to maximize every possible resource and to keep those resources in the classrooms and for our students. I serve on the College and Career Advantage Board (formerly South Coast ROP), which provides relevant cutting-edge career technical education and college/career pathways for CUSD students and adults. I am also working to launch the comprehensive College and Career Center in the Shops at Mission Viejo, serving the needs of 21st-century students and their busy families. Despite severe fiscal challenges created in Sacramento, my focus is to provide our children with maximum educational opportunities so that they may pursue their college and career goals to become tomorrow's educated workforce and innovators.
More than ever, our children deserve a quality public education that provides unlimited opportunities to effectively compete and excel.

Gould Workman, Sales Manager
Gould Workman
I have worked the past 22 years as a project manager and sales manager. I have learned to value 'the team,' lead by example and effectively plan and communicate. I am active in our community, serve in a key role on our PTA board, and am active in my church, serving and working with our valuable youth. I am also a graduate of Brigham Young University.
As a father of five children in our district, and the husband to an amazing wife and CUSD teacher, I want to continue taking an active role in the improvement of our local education system. I am deeply committed to helping our schools adequately plan for the challenges of future growth within the district's limited funding resources. At the heart of it all, I believe, unequivocally, in the value of public education. I believe in the democratic process and understand that a trustee's role is to act in line with the interests of the entire school community, with total fiscal responsibility. For the past 15 years, our district board of trustees has not actively put the constituents first. I am the solution to this and the advocate for change, putting our kids and families in our district first in everything.
Unfortunately, many in our community are outraged by the dismissive treatment of the current school board. It is my resolute commitment to listen to and represent all members of the community and allow their voices to be reflected in the decisions the board makes. If elected, I will use my voice to refocus our administration on what is truly important—our children, teaching and learning. I hope you will give me the opportunity to serve you and our awesome district by voting for me this coming Election Day.
Jim Reardon, Incumbent, Business Owner/Engineer
Jim Reardon
As the school board vice president, I am able to see past the rhetoric of educational insiders to protect our students and schools. I favor classroom reform, school choice, local control, program innovation and fair taxation. I represent the communities of Ladera Ranch, Las Flores, Wagon Wheel, Coto de Caza, Trabuco, eastern San Juan Capistrano, Sendero and Esencia, most of which pay Mello-Roos taxes that supported new school construction.
In 2012, I promised never to vote for a tax increase. I vigorously oppose CUSD's $889 million bond, Measure M, on the November ballot that will triple-tax Mello-Roos areas. It unfairly burdens younger communities. I will guard against abuse of this enormous $1.8 billion local tax if it should pass. I recommend a ""no"" vote.
Since 2013, as a board member I have championed fairness in management of Mello-Roos tax districts. This has produced tax reductions of $81 million, while ensuring that CUSD’s credit rating remains solid.
I will continue work to open new schools to serve Esencia and surrounding areas on time. These projects, as well as expansion of San Juan Hills High School are underway, and their funding is unaffected by Measure M.
I am a parent, computer engineer, active business owner and founder of a successful nonprofit school serving 6-12 grade students with autism. I seek to raise quality of education for all students including those with disabilities, and increase enrichment, vocational and sports opportunities in our schools.
I am proud of my reputation as the most accessible and responsive member of our school board. The duty of a member to help families to work with our enormous organization to resolve individual problems for students is one I take most seriously.
Reelect me, Jim Reardon, to the Capistrano Unified school board.
Trustee Area 3: Truman Benedict Elementary, Concordia Elementary, Marblehead Elementary, Clarence Lobo Elementary, Vista del Mar Elementary, Bernice Ayer Middle School, Vista del Mar Middle School, San Clemente High School
Laura Ferguson, Public Information Officer
Laura Ferguson
As a parent, I am grateful to be raising my children in San Clemente. I've enjoyed serving residents as a city employee for 17 years. I am running for school board because I am committed to making the district work for all students and parents/taxpayers. Leaders at CUSD promote the district as being the top performing school district in California, when it ranks 31st in math and 23rd in English. This presents an opportunity to encourage continuous improvement. We can do better!
Volunteering is my passion. Most recently, I led a citizen advocacy group. Together we fought for Talega taxpayers who CUSD was overtaxing by $2.3 million annually and remedied the abuses, saving $60 million over the life of our Mello-Roos payments.
If you elect me, I will hold the district accountable to all of San Clemente and ensure the responsible use of tax dollars, while minimizing consulting costs so more money can be spent in the classroom. I will be accessible to you and care about your concerns.
I serve on Assemblyman Bill Brough's Education Advisory Committee. I've been involved in a parent-led effort to bring quality school choice to the southernmost part of CUSD where none currently exists. Our number one goal must be to provide a quality education to the diverse children of our community.
I've attended school board meetings for three consecutive years, speaking on behalf of parents/taxpayers at many meetings. We need new leadership who value the public's voice. I oppose CUSD's billion dollar bond because of the absence of specificity, haphazard compilation and lack of assurance that the projects will ever be completed.
Our chance to hit the reset button on this school board is Nov. 8. Reject the status quo and vote for new leadership.

Prestigious College or Major: Which Pays off More? 4:21
How much of a role does the prestige of a college or university play in a student's career success? Brigham Young University professor of economics Eric Eide, lead author of a broad study of college graduates, explains that is has a lot to do with a student's major. Photo: Getty

Prestigious College or Major: Which Pays off More?

University attrition rates: Why are so many students dropping out?
Liz Burke, news.com.au
September 9, 2016 7:48am
FIRST year university students are leaving their original chosen courses at a higher rate than ever.
New data shows about one in five commencing bachelor students left their original course in 2014, and about 15 per cent dropped out completely.
The figures also see the increase in the number of students not completing their chosen course climb to more than one million for the first time.
Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, are defending the figures. They point out that while overall attrition rates are up, when it comes to the percentage of students dropping out of university completely in their first year (the adjusted attrition rate), the average figure is similar to past years, sticking at around 15 per cent for the past decade.
But the number of students leaving their first year courses is increasing — whether they find another place for themselves in the higher education system or not.
At the university with the worst attrition rate, the University of Tasmania, 42.26 per cent of first year students left their course during the first year, with most of those — 38.13 per cent of all first year students — dropped out of university altogether.
The University of Melbourne had the lowest attrition rate at 7.5 per cent. Its adjusted rate — taking out students who had left their course but enrolled in another — was only 3.74 per cent.
Universities Australia Deputy Chief Executive Catriona Jackson told news.com.au the attrition rates were no indictment on tertiary education providers. Rather, it was a “major achievement” that university access had been expanded to more Australians while keeping the dropout rate relatively stable.
“Research suggests attrition rates are higher for mature age and part-time students — and if you think about it, they’re the ones who may often be juggling university study with jobs, children and caring for elderly parents,” she said.
“Students battling disadvantage — including those who are first in their family to attend university — are also more likely to have thoughts about leaving.”
The experiences of disadvantaged students highlighted the importance of student support programs run by universities, which help students to find the support and resources they need to complete their degree, Ms Jackson said.
“The biggest factors for students who consider leaving university are often related to issues beyond university,” she said.
“They cite pressures with their health or stress, juggling work/life balance, the need to do paid work, their overall workload and financial difficulties among the top reasons for doing so.”
Grattan Institute higher education expert Andrew Norton told The Australian the attrition rates were worrying.
“The question is: are universities actually informing students of the risks they are taking on, particularly studying online, and are they being responsible in taking on students who are at high risk of not completing?”
The new data comes as the Federal Government awaits a report detailing recommendations about how best to make things clearer for students and keep them better informed.
The Higher Education Standards Panel, which is currently reviewing submissions over university admissions, has acknowledged greater transparency for students is needed to reshape higher education.

Conor Orr,9/9/2016 0:05,"Around the NFL
Marvin Lewis has a record of 112-94-2 in 14 years as the Bengals ' head coach. (Associated Press)
When Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis accepted a full scholarship to Idaho State University back in the late 1970s, what he knew of the campus was based on an idyllic description painted by recruiters: a school in the mountains.
It was a long way from McDonald, Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh suburb where Lewis grew into a formidable quarterback and safety at Fort Cherry High School. It was a long way from Purdue, where Lewis planned to walk on before making a decision that would save his family thousands of dollars. It was a long way from his old way of life. According to a Cincinnati Enquirer story from 2003 , some school officials apologized to Lewis when he got there, upon learning he was black, for giving him a white roommate.
""I knew nothing. I knew literally nothing,"" he told me recently, laughing at the image of a young man stepping off a plane and onto a campus nestled between the Old Tom and South Putnam Mountains.
""They pick you up and they show you the indoor stadium and the mini-dome. That's impressive when you're a young kid. But I was going to be happy wherever I went, because my parents didn't have to pay for school. I was fortunate to go to school there and spend time in the mountain west. Go to Montana, Bozeman; places that I otherwise never would have had an opportunity to experience in life. You want to go back to Yellowstone and places like that.""
In that Enquirer story from 2003, Idaho State athletic trainer Phil Luckey credited the conditions in Pocatello for developing the man who would become Cincinnati's head coach.
And as we approach Week 1 of the NFL season, Luckey's words have never carried more weight -- on a level that is surely beyond what Luckey would have imagined. Lewis, who, after concluding his playing career, joined the Idaho State coaching staff as a graduate assistant in 1981 and worked there until 1984, may be the most recognizable figure from that time -- but on any given day during his tenure, he could have made a short drive in nearly any direction and bumped into someone who turned into a big-time influencer in the NFL today.
New Buccaneers head coach Dirk Koetter, a Pocatello native who had been a teammate of Lewis' at Idaho State, had his first coaching gig just down the road at Highland High School (1983-84). Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer was in Ogden, Utah, at Weber State, where he worked as a defensive assistant from 1981 to '88. Bears head coach John Fox was at Boise State in 1980 and Utah in 1982. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid played at Brigham Young in Provo, Utah, from 1979 to 1981 and was a graduate assistant there in 1982 before heading to San Francisco State in 1983. A few years after Lewis' stint in Idaho, Colts head coach Chuck Pagano coached linebackers at Boise State (1987-88). Koetter also returned to the area as the head coach at Boise State from 1998 to 2000.
Some of the NFL's best coordinators and position coaches emerged from the hotbed and went on to mold some of the most talked about players in the league today. Cowboys offensive coordinator Scott Linehan, who is from Sunnyside, Washington, played at Idaho from 1982 to '86 and served as an assistant there from 1989 to 1990 and again from 1992 to '93. Seahawks offensive line coach and assistant head coach Tom Cable played at Idaho with Linehan and served as a graduate assistant there in 1987 and '88 before returning as head coach from 2000 to '03.
Essentially, if you want to win the Super Bowl in 2016, there's a good chance your road travels through beautiful, snow-capped mountains and picturesque national parks. Lewis (AFC North), Zimmer (NFC North) and Pagano (AFC South) could all be considered favorites -- or, at least, strong possibilities -- to win their respective divisions. Koetter is developing one of the best young quarterbacks in football (Jameis Winston), while Linehan is creating a dynamic run-first scheme in Dallas that could once again shake up the NFC East.
""We were kind of way off in the distance of 1-AA leagues, but grew up with kind of early revolutionaries in football,"" Linehan told me recently.
He added: ""We're proud of our Northwest upbringing and heritage. People talk about coaching circles and things like that, and there's a definite fraternity of coaches who grew up here and coached college football in this area.""
One reason for the boom? Coaches from the time period point to the Big Sky Conference as the launching pad for the modern NFL spread offense. Dennis Erickson, who later coached the Seahawks and 49ers , brought a version of the spread from San Jose State to Idaho in 1982 (Linehan and Cable were on the Idaho team that Erickson coached to the Big Sky Championship in '85), and the revolution spread as fast as coaches could drive back and forth on I-84.
Records for most receiving yards in a Big Sky game (299, by Treamelle Taylor of Nevada, set in 1989), total yards in a game (876, Weber State vs. Idaho State, 1985) and touchdowns in a game (12, Montana State vs. Eastern Oregon, 1985) were routinely broken and re-set throughout a time of rapid offensive development. Ravens quarterbacks coach Marty Mornhinweg, a quarterback at Montana from 1982 to '85, set 15 school passing records.
""People had to adjust and see the game change at our level before it even hit the major conferences,"" Linehan said. ""We all agreed that we were seeing stuff in our part of the world that hadn't reached all corners of the United States. People were still running pretty conventional offenses. Run-oriented, wishbone, split-back, veer type stuff, and we were rapidly changing that here in the Big Sky.""
While that often meant torture for defensive coaches like Zimmer and Lewis, it forced them to be prepared for anything. On top of numerous responsibilities -- Lewis, for example, said he ran the Idaho State junior varsity team, and he would be responsible for everything from calling the plays to wrangling students walking around BYU's campus after a game -- these coaches had to design ways to stop offenses people had never seen before.
Lewis always had a busy mind while crammed inside a dealer car on endless road trips. High school games in Idaho on Friday, driving through the night until game time Saturday.
""Think about riding a bus 10 hours to Reno,"" Lewis said. ""As graduate assistants, if we wanted to go to the games, maybe at like Portland State, we had to drive. Those were fun times. Now, you think about it differently, but when I was coaching at Idaho State and we were going to Northern Arizona and the charter was full ... those were the things you had to do.""
Back then, the coaches from the old Pac-10 were idols of sorts. They held lavish golf tournaments -- the obvious object of every young, hungry head coach's affection back at a time when they were making no money and praying their cars could get them from one stadium to the next.
So Lewis smiles when he thinks about the Big Sky Golf Tournament, something of an answer to the world around them. They played in Sun Valley and Ogden. Just a few young coaches swinging away, completely unaware that they couldn't have been in a better place.

Pagosa Springs Sun,9/9/2016 0:06,"UU topic: ‘Insights From Three 19th Century American Prophets’
By Dick Richardson
Special to The PREVIEW
The Pagosa Unitarian Universalist Fellowship invites you to attend a program titled 'Insights From Three 19th Century American Prophets,' with Dick Richardson, this Sunday, Sept. 11, for its regular service.
Unitarian Universalists are not asked to accept any prescribed spiritual truth. Instead they are asked to identify their own faith beliefs using six sources, which include, 'The words and deeds of prophetic women and men which challenge us to the transforming power of love.'
The task of defining a faith that is useful in understanding and living constructively within the American context turns out to be never-ending.
Two hundred years ago, the United States, barely a quarter century old, faced a developing crisis that was to culminate in a civil war. Three American prophets, each born early in the 19th century, provided leadership, spiritual insights and future hope for millions of Americans.
This presentation will highlight the lives and achievements of Brigham Young, Henry Ward Beecher and Theodore Parker as they provided spiritual and practical leadership to a society struggling to cope with slavery, women’s rights, massive immigration and balancing the need for community with individual rights and freedoms.
Each of the three was a leader in helping men and women develop spirituality, and each broke with the prevailing culture to propose ideas that continue to shape what we believe today. They came from differing points on the political spectrum, offering conservative, populist and liberal perspectives.
The Americans most influenced by Young, Beecher and Parker remain at different points along the political and theological continuum, but continue to share many values that guide their respective searches for spiritual growth, including the importance of community, equity, inclusiveness and justice for all.
The message asks what the examination of their lives and times can tell contemporary Americans about culture and society, as these shape our own searches for understanding and spirituality. Do their experiences offer insights that can help us understand how to live an ethical and productive life in today’s world?

cwjim,9/9/2016 0:07,"We all aren't the same, so why should all policies be the same? BYU is a religious school that doesn't believe in homosexuality. It's their right to ban the practice. Just like it's perfectly in the right for some other university to ban Christianity being practiced at the school. I wouldn't care if Notre Dame was ONLY Catholic. I don't care that some schools are ONLY black(or mostly). Birds of the feather should be allowed to flock together. It's only a problem when a lot of schools ban a group of people denying them rights. There are plenty of places that accept homosexual behavior. BYU isn't one of them, and shouldn't be one of them.
If the Big 12 doesn't want to include them because of that, that's their right. However, I think they aren't actually helping the situation. They are not including one group, because of another group. That doesn't lead to diversity. Quite frankly it's the opposite. Include both, put them together, and that's how you get diversity. There was a time when blacks weren't allowed to play college football. Eventually, teams that had black players played teams that did. It wasn't just the teams with blacks beating the teams that didn't that caused integration. It was the respect for the toughness and intelligence of the blacks by the players and fans that caused it.
I am guessing in the years to come, BYU will include homosexual students. If they are invited to the Big 12, I am betting it will happen sooner.

1,700-year-old obituary translated
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published On: Sep 08 2016 08:10:15 AM MDT Updated On: Sep 08 2016 10:21:52 AM MDT
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

JOHN ALTAVILLA,9/9/2016 0:15,"
No Word From UConn About Its Pitch To Big 12 Administrators What Can UConn Offer The Big 12? 
Everyone knows football is king, but UConn has plenty more to offer the Big 12. The program gets its chance to tell the Big 12 Conference why on Thursday when UConn makes its official presentation to the Power 5 league. 
Everyone knows football is king, but UConn has plenty more to offer the Big 12. The program gets its chance to tell the Big 12 Conference why on Thursday when UConn makes its official presentation to the Power 5 league. John Altavilla had its day before the Big 12 on Thursday, extolling the virtues of the university and its athletic department in hopes of being included in the expansion of the Power Five conference.
President Susan Herbst and athletic director Dave Benedict were among the contingent representing the Huskies in or near Dallas before a Big 12 expansion committee headed by conference commissioner Bob Bowlsby. 
At stake could be the future of UConn as a major player in college athletics. 
University spokeswoman Stephanie Reitz said Thursday there would be no information forthcoming about the meeting from UConn. The Big 12 has imposed a strict media blackout on itself and those institutions interested in joining the league. Still, UConn's goal was apparent. The Huskies needed to convince the Big 12 that its university and athletic department are worthy of inclusion in a league that would bring prestige and more dollars to the campus. 
The areas the university was expected to cover Thursday were as diverse as they are immense in the give-and-take with the Big 12. 
On Wednesday, former UConn athletic director Todd Turner said geography might work against the Huskies. The distance between Austin, Texas , and Storrs (approximately 1,900 miles) likely remains one of the Huskies' biggest obstacles in the competition. 
A former UConn athletic director said the Huskies have a lot going for them as they try to get into the Big 12 , but geography could be a major stumbling block.
UConn is scheduled to make its formal presentation for admission to the Big 12 Conference on Thursday in Dallas, according to a source... 
A former UConn athletic director said the Huskies have a lot going for them as they try to get into the Big 12 , but geography could be a major stumbling block. 
UConn is scheduled to make its formal presentation for admission to the Big 12 Conference on Thursday in Dallas, according to a source... (JOHN ALTAVILLA) 
The Big 12 presidents might look at the travel for their minor teams as just too tenuous to take on, particularly in the winter. 
""If it weren't for geography, I think they would be in great shape [for inclusion],"" Turner said. 
The Associated Press reported the Big 12 has made a point in its meetings to ask about the accessibility of airports. This would seem to be particularly important for UConn, which must sell the convenience of Bradley International Airport. Bradley is about 35 miles from the UConn campus. 
Another source spoke directly to that geography issue on Thursday, telling The Courant that ""if [UConn] was 500 miles closer, it would already be in [the Big 12]."" (PAUL DOYLE) 
One way to solve the geography problem would be to admit UConn as a football-only school, the scenario that seems to be developing with BYU. That is considered a long shot, although it is possible the Big East would like a reunion with UConn men's and women's basketball and the prestige it brings. UConn also has fared well in many other sports. 
The Big 12 has also been asking detailed information about the sports programs from each university, according to the Associated Press. Meetings are scheduled to end early next week. Houston met with officials on Tuesday, Central Florida was in on Wednesday. 
Big 12 leadership is expected to make its recommendations to conference presidents, its board of directors, in time for their meeting on Oct. 17. 
The presidents are expected to choose two schools or not expand at all. Not expanding would apparently dash Bowlsby's wishes. His contention is that the Big 12 needs 12 schools to create a conference championship game in football with two divisions of six schools. 
Houston, which knocked off No. 3 Oklahoma in football Saturday, is still considered the favorite, with UConn in a group with BYU and Cincinnati for the second spot. Cincinnati is just 300 miles from West Virginia , which has the most ambitious travel schedule in the Big 12. 
BYU's candidacy might be impacted by the LGBT issues surrounding it. Students at Iowa State this week passed a resolution against BYU's inclusion in the Big 12. 
Cincinnati's football pedigree is strong. The Bearcats won four Big East Conference championships over the course of five years (2008-2012). Since 2007, Cincinnati has appeared in nine bowl games, including the Orange and Sugar Bowl. 
Many reports say UConn is trailing BYU and Cincinnati, with Houston considered the favorite. 
Turner spoke glowingly of UConn as a candidate for the Big 12, saying its football program is on enough solid ground to make it viable and that its national championship basketball programs will be an asset the school should sell hard. 
""UConn has a lot going for it,"" Turner said. ""One thing these conferences want is someone who has actually [won] as opposed to what someone might say that are going to do. I think UConn has done it.""

KMIZ,9/9/2016 0:20,"1,700-year-old obituary translated
Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
POSTED: 09:10 AM CDT Sep 08, 2016  UPDATED: 11:21 AM CDT Sep 08, 2016 
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Cassini probe discovers dunes and mountains on Titan
by Brett Smith
On a recent close flyby of Saturn’s moon Titan, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft was able to capture images of fine details on the moon’s surface.
Among other things, the images revealed long straight dunes of what is thought to be hydrocarbon sand. These dunes were seen circling the majority of Titan’s equator. NASA scientists said studying the dunes can help them learn about winds, landscapes and the sands themselves.
""Dunes are dynamic features. They're deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,"" Jani Radebaugh , a Cassini radar team member from Brigham Young University, said in a news release .
The new Cassini images also showed a place previously dubbed the ""Xanadu annex"" by the Cassini radar team. Cassini's radar had not taken pictures of this region, but previous measurements by the spacecraft indicated the terrain might be quite comparable to the large area on Titan named Xanadu, the first feature to be identified on Titan. The Hubble Space Telescope captured images of Xanadu's outline in 1994. The annex region went undetected until the Cassini mission.
Learning About Titan
The new Cassini image showed the Xanadu annex is comprised of the same kind of mountainous terrains identified in Xanadu and dispersed across other areas of Titan.
""This 'annex' looks quite similar to Xanadu using our radar, but there seems to be something different about the surface there that masks this similarity when observing at other wavelengths, as with Hubble,"" said Mike Janssen , a member of the Cassini radar team. ""It's an interesting puzzle.""
Xanadu and its annex continue to be a bit of a mystery to NASA researchers. In other places on Titan, mountainous surfaces appear in small, separated patches, but Xanadu includes a large mountainous area. Scientists have proposed a range of theories on how it might have been created.
""These mountainous areas appear to be the oldest terrains on Titan, probably remnants of the icy crust before it was covered by organic sediments from the atmosphere,"" said Rosaly Lopes , a Cassini radar team member. ""Hiking in these rugged landscapes would likely be similar to hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota.""
Cassini has four remaining flybys left in its mission, and these passes will focus on the liquid lakes and seas in Titan's northern hemisphere. In April 2017, the probe will perform a series of 22 orbits that will send it between Saturn and its icy rings.

Daily Utah Chronicle,9/9/2016 0:29,"Utah Sure to Crush Cougars With new Gear
Nicholas Coleman
on September 8, 2016 at 3:58 pm
As the college football season sets in, many can't wait until the BYU Cougars arrive here at Rice-Eccles on Saturday. Across campus, MUSS members can be heard warming up their lungs and stocking fraternity houses in preparation for a weekend filled with festivity. Indeed, everyone on campus is anticipating the game infamously known as the 'Holy War.' Following a rather tumultuous weekend filled with a handful of collegiate upsets, including the thorough annihilation of USC by the University of Alabama, coach Kyle Whittingham of Utah made a surprising announcement earlier this week. Citing his innate confidence that BYU will lose this year’s game, Whittingham has decided to remove modern equipment from his players, making a return to the classic leather uniforms worn throughout the early 1900's.
While this announcement came as a surprise to many, no other group suffered from greater disbelief than the NCAA — the regulatory body for collegiate athletics. Realizing that their preoccupation with stripping players of their rights had blinded them from establishing a rule against the retro-attire, the NCAA permitted Coach Whittingham to proceed. With secure legal footing, Whittingham has chosen to switch to leather padding for the coming weekend, and potentially even longer. Although BYU initially resisted, their honor code prevented them from verbally protesting, meaning the game will continue unabated. Thus, as this weekend starts to near, a certain deliverance of knowledge can be felt descending upon the entire student body.
We must equip our players with the same gear as our ancestors from the early 20th century.
In an attempt to normalize the situation, allow me explain the logic behind the idea. Between the period of 1898 to 1941, the U established an eighteen game winning streak against Brigham Young University. Indeed, the Utes domesticated the wild Cougars numerous times, all while wearing the tanned leather hides of cattle. The pads, filled with the thickest wool felt available in the early 1900’s, are easily attached to any section of the body. The cushioning is typically layered over stylish turtle necks, accented with red stitching along the seams of each shirt. While controversial, plastic helmets were developed around the late 1940’s, meaning they were likely inaccessible to the U during their winning streak. Seeing as it’s vital to keep all traditions intact, leather helmets will indeed be utilized for the game.
Predictably, Whittingham received criticism on this point, especially from those who suggest that football causes 'irreversible brain damage.' However, to say that Whittingham properly deflected these concerns would be an understatement. Citing former NFL executives and certified team doctors, Whittingham contended that concussions certainly don’t cause permanent brain damage to players. Rather, they teach young men that establishing manhood revolves around having your 'bell rung,' a point that everyone can agree upon rather easily. Thus, the uniforms that the Utes will wear Sept. 10th will consist of the following: leather shoulder pads filled with wool, loose fitting padded pants, leather helmets with smaller holes to promote airflow, and wooden cleats.
While this might seem a little superstitious, the Utes are reportedly feeling confident about the game, especially as they channel the strength of former players. Yet the implications of this game stretch beyond the scope of Saturday, as there is the added potential of employing these outfits for the matchup against USC on Sept. 23. Following an unbelievably rocky season opener versus the University of Alabama, USC’s status as a national contender is certainly being questioned. This, in the eyes of Whittingham, is an opportunity he seeks to capitalize upon. While acknowledging the Trojan’s gentility and class, an enduring characteristic of the team, the Utes hope to defeat their fellow PAC-12 rival handily. The leather padding employed during the 1900’s should indeed withstand the impact delivered by modern polycarbonate helmets, in addition to establishing the aforementioned manhood of players.
While the decision regarding attire for Sept. 23 is undecided, contingent upon the results against BYU, those planning on attending the Sept. 10 game are encouraged to imitate former spectators. This can be accomplished through purchasing fine top hats and corsets for game day, in addition to an umbrella should any sunlight or rain emerge. Should everything go according to plan, however, the Utes should be able to reestablish their dominant forty-three year winning streak against BYU. Until then, get ready to spectate one of the most electric rivalries this side of the Mississippi River, and keep warming up those lungs.

limelightbeta,9/9/2016 0:30,"""Just briefly on last week's game, after watching the film, it was pretty much what we thought after the game. We just didn't have our usual physicality up front. That's what was lacking. We have to get that corrected. I mentioned that we weren't explosive enough offensively. I know we got those chunk yards, but we weren't explosive enough scoring points. Those were the two main issues. We couldn't finish drives and didn't play with physicality. Our trademark is to be physical.
""Rivalry week is back on. It's been a couple years since we played in the regular season. It's at our place so obviously, we're excited about that. It should be a great crowd and atmosphere. Our guys will be ready. There's no doubt about that. Their guys will be ready. We're sure of that as well. It should make for a great game like it traditionally has been.""
Utah got the first shut out since 2012 in their 24-0 win over Southern Utah.
""We played solid in all three position groups: front, secondary and linebacker. [Southern Utah] did a really nice job of trying to get the ball out of the quarterback's hand quickly, maybe too quickly at times, and that led to some inefficiencies in their throw game. Our front played solid, not as dominant as we can be, but it was a good start to the season. We were pleased with the inexperienced linebackers. Cody [Barton] and Sunia [Tauteoli], who were No. 1 and No. 2 in tackling on the team. The secondary did a nice job. We had very few issues on the back end. It was a combination of all three position groups just playing solid.""
BYU head coach Kalani Sitake is a former Utah coach and was one of Whittingham’s first assistant coaches.
""I consider [Sitake] a close friend. There are few people in this profession who are considered close friends, he is one of them. I don't think it has any bearing on the game itself. He's a guy who was with me when I first got the job, he was one of my first hires, and he did a great job for us while he was here. I'm sure he's going to do a great job down there. He's off to a good start.
""In the offseason we had a golf tournament and one or two other things together where we crossed paths and we went golfing a couple times together this summer. Like I said, he's a close friend. We talked a little bit of ball, but not a whole lot. We talked more about family and what's going on in our lives. [Sitake] being the head coach of a rival school doesn't impact my relationship with him at all. I still have the utmost respect for him. Our friendship is solid and I expect that to continue.
""[Recruiting against Sitake] is just like recruiting against anyone else. You recruit against the university more so than any specific coach. We crossed paths on a few kids in state, but other than that, there's not a lot of crossing paths in recruiting kids, particularly out of state. It's more Pac-12 schools that we come across in southern California in our recruiting footprint. They're more of a national recruiting base.""
Polynesian players have played a very important role for the Utah football team.
""It started with [former Utah head] Coach Mac [Ron McBride]. He's the one who opened up the pipeline to Utah football, I guess you could say. We've been perpetuating it ever since. It's been about 23 years and Coach Mac made a decision back then that he was going to make it a priority to recruit the Polynesian athlete and that's been a huge part of the success here at Utah.""
BYU kicked off their season with an 18-16 win against Arizona.
""Offensively, they were very balanced. No. 21 [running back Jamaal Williams] is a very good player. He was the work horse. He carried the ball nearly 30 times. Taysom [Hill] did a nice job running the offense. They had over 200 yards rushing and over 200 yards throwing. To me, the key to having an effective offense is having balance. The offensive line played pretty well. Defensively, they got after it and played hard. They controlled the ball offensively and didn't give Arizona a lot of snaps. Arizona only had about 45-50 snaps, that's not their formula. That's not how Arizona wins. They did a nice job of keeping the Arizona offense on the sidelines.
""The offense [under first-year coordinator Ty Detmer] was very similar to what I anticipated. [Detmer] did a nice job with his play calling. I'm surely glad Taysom [Hill] is back, even though they have another outstanding quarterback as well. They did a very nice job of utilizing personnel groups and keeping Arizona off balance. They have a very high-percentage offense, particularly in the throw game. They run a lot of high-percentage stuff, which is great.""
In Utah-BYU games, turnovers have played a huge role.
""They're big in every game. There's no more important stat than the turnover margin. I'm sure it will be a big part of this game, just like it has been the last several games in the rivalry and really every week. There's nothing special about that stat in just this game, but we've had a pretty good run in winning the turnover margin. As far as the importance of it, it's every week.""
Even though Utah played BYU in the Las Vegas Bowl last season, they are completely different this year because of the coaching changes.
""It's a whole different ball game. The schemes are dramatically different on both sides of the ball. Obviously, we know we'll see things that we didn't see on the film against Arizona. Everyone is going to tailor their game plan to the upcoming opponent. We know what teams like to do against us. They play a lot of man coverage so therefore there are a lot of 'man beaters' in the throw game. We're fairly certain there will be a fair amount of new stuff and change from what they did against Arizona, who uses a primary 3-3 front and is a whole different animal on defense from what we are.""
Whittingham was asked if he felt the rivalry has changed since Utah joined the Pac-12 in 2011.
""As far as the feel for me personally, in conference or out of conference, there really is no difference. It's the rivalry game. It doesn't have conference implications obviously, but it's every bit as intense. Maybe there has been a little bit of a change in the venom in the game, but that's more of a fan question than for me. Taking those two years off probably had more of an impact than not being in the same conference.""
The offensive line did not quite play up to their potential against Southern Utah.
""I have no concerns because I know that they're a prideful group. They'll rebound and they'll play well. I have a lot of confidence in those guys. They're good players. My guess is that they're going to prepare very well this week and be ready to play on Saturday. ""
BYU running back Jamaal Williams played well to start the season against Arizona.
""He's a tough, physical runner. He has size, speed and runs with a great deal of violence. He runs like a running back is supposed to run. He had a very good game, obviously, against Arizona with a bunch of carries and he was the focal point of the offense.""
BYU quarterback Taysom Hill is a talented athlete and can challenge a defense with his legs as a dual-threat quarterback.
""We see quite a few of those guys throughout the course of the year. The dual-threat quarterback pretty much is what football is today with a few exceptions. We just have to be assignment sound. It's almost like playing Air Force, in a respect. When you're playing the read option, your defensive ends have to be very disciplined and take care of their assignments. [Hill] didn't run as much in this past game as he had in years past. I don't know if that's by design or just how the plan was set last week, but we know his capabilities. He's a very potent runner.""
Utah wide receivers coach Guy Holliday coached at BYU previously and can provide some unique insight on his former players.
""He has some insight that we obviously don't have after being around [BYU] for the last few years. He knows things like what kind of practice players they are, what kind of mentality they have or what may bother them or not bother them, as far as press technique or playing off. ""
Playing BYU in the 2015 Las Vegas Bowl only helped Utah with personnel, but the schemes will be totally different with the new coaches.
""No benefits other than knowledge of personnel and matchups. Those are really the only things that are applicable because the schemes are so different.""
Joe Williams is still listed as the starter at running back despite fumbling against Southern Utah. Other players will also see reps at running back against BYU.
""We'll give the other guys turns. Like I said, we weren't physical enough up front running the football [against Southern Utah]. We didn't run with enough reckless abandon. We have to run like we can't be tackled, not run like we're waiting to be tackled.""
Utah jumped to a 35-0 first quarter against BYU in the 2015 Las Vegas Bowl.
""I've never been involved in a start like that either way. What was going through my mind was, 'Are you kidding me?'"" Seven or eight minutes into the game, it was 35-0. That's almost unheard of. Almost.""
Whittingham was asked what the most memorable game was during his playing career at BYU. He was also asked if he would rather play or coach.
""I would say the SMU game [in the 1980 Holiday Bowl], as far as my college career. That would be the most memorable game.
""I would rather play than coach in the rivalry game, and that's every week. I can't do that anymore.""

When the Big 12 Conference made it public and stated they wanted to grow the conference as soon as they possibly could it made more than a few people raise their collective eyebrows.
Schools still being considered candidates are bound by non-disclosure agreements by the Big 12, and Colorado State is still playing by that rule.
The Big 12 has reportedly narrowed its list of expansions schools to ""six to eight"" potential candidates.
The report added that the University of Houston and University of Cincinnati are the other two strong school contenders.
Just days away from the start of football season, the Big 12 Conference said no to East Carolina University.
The remaining candidates are expected to have a second round of interviews in the coming weeks, this time in person in Dallas.
So, we know, based on school's issuing press releases, that the Big 12 has at least told SOME schools thanks, but no thanks.
These universities are Air Force, BYU, UCF, Cincinnati, Colorado State, UConn, Houston, Rice, South Florida, SMU, Temple and Tulane are still in the running.
I have confirmed Big 12 informed UC it has made initial cut and advancing in expansion process. The report indicated it's becoming less likely that the league would expand to 14 teams, opting for only two additions to 12 or remaining at 10. The presidents meet again in early October. Only the estimated jackpot in this instance was the $30 million or so difference in revenue between what a member the Big 12 takes in and the Pirates' current payout from the American Athletic Conference. East Carolina announced Wednesday it had received a letter from the conference informing the school it was no longer on the list.
Memphis officials have been tight lipped on progress of their proposal to enter the Big 12.

Kornmesser's impression shows a view of the surface of the planet Proxima b. The impression shows a view of the surface of the planet Proxima b orbiting the red dwarf star Proxima Centauri, the closest star to the Solar System. Proxima b is a little more massive than the Earth and orbits in the habitable zone around Proxima Centauri, where the temperature is suitable for liquid water to exist on its surface. (Photo: ESO/M. Kornmesser) 
Like a minimalist home decorator, the Creator – if He, She or It exists – seems to have an inordinate fondness for empty spaces. 
This week’s announcement that a habitable planet has been discovered orbiting the Sun’s nearest neighbor, a star named Proxima Centauri , has raised hopes of finding life elsewhere in the universe, perhaps even intelligent life. But it also intensifies our sense of cosmic isolation. 
We humans are social creatures. A study published last year by psychologists at Brigham Young University found that loneliness, social isolation, or living alone significantly increase one’s risk of early death. We crave contact; it’s woven into our DNA. 
Maybe that’s why we search the skies for others, driven by a need to reassure ourselves that we’re not alone in a vast and impersonal universe. 
RELATED : Scientists discover Earth-like planet orbiting star closest to our sun 
This fear is nothing new. ""The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread,” wrote Blaise Pascal, the seventeenth-century mathematician and philosopher. John Burroughs, the nineteenth-century naturalist, called it the “cosmic chill.” 
A century ago, astronomers thought they saw a network of straight lines crisscrossing the surface of Mars. Speculation arose that these “canals” were built by an advanced Martian civilization to irrigate the red planet’s arid regions. Percival Lowell, who built the observatory that bears his name to map these canals, was convinced that earthlings were “destined to discover any number of cousins scattered through space.”

But the canals of Mars turned out to be an illusion, fueled by overactive imaginations and a yearning to find kindred spirits elsewhere in the universe. 
Today more than 3,000 planets are known to exist around other stars, and new ones are discovered almost daily. Even if only a tiny fraction of them are hospitable to life, the universe is likely to be so full of living creatures there’s probably a Starbucks in every solar system. 
But we shouldn’t fire up the barbecue to welcome our neighbors just yet. Although nearby by astronomical standards, Proxima Centauri is unimaginably far by any human measure. Driving at highway speeds it would take nearly 50 million years to get there. Even the New Horizons spacecraft that whizzed past Pluto last year would need 55,000 years to reach Proxima Centauri. 
MY TURN : What compels us to explore starry skies? 
The quickest way to communicate with any Proxima Centaurians would be to transmit messages with light, the interstellar equivalent of texting. A “how r u?” beamed to the newly discovered planet would arrive in just four years. That’s a lot faster than chatting with aliens on more distant worlds, where the lag time between sending and receiving messages would be measured in millennia. Still, in an age when we grow impatient with websites that take more than a second to load, waiting eight years to exchange greetings or recipes with Proxima Centauri might seem an eternity. 
Maybe someday our descendants will voyage among the stars in search of strange and exotic creatures on other worlds. In the end, however, the quest for life beyond our solar system may say more about our species’ psychological needs than anything else. As the great New England poet Robert Frost put it: 
They cannot scare me with their empty spaces 
Between stars — on stars where no human race is. 
I have it in me so much nearer home 
To scare myself with my own desert places.

University attrition rates: Why are so many students dropping out?
Liz Burke, news.com.au
September 9, 2016 7:48am
FIRST year university students are leaving their original chosen courses at a higher rate than ever.
New data shows about one in five commencing bachelor students left their original course in 2014, and about 15 per cent dropped out completely.
The figures also see the increase in the number of students not completing their chosen course climb to more than one million for the first time.
Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, are defending the figures. They point out that while overall attrition rates are up, when it comes to the percentage of students dropping out of university completely in their first year (the adjusted attrition rate), the average figure is similar to past years, sticking at around 15 per cent for the past decade.
But the number of students leaving their first year courses is increasing — whether they find another place for themselves in the higher education system or not.
At the university with the worst attrition rate, the University of Tasmania, 42.26 per cent of first year students left their course during the first year, with most of those — 38.13 per cent of all first year students — dropped out of university altogether.
The University of Melbourne had the lowest attrition rate at 7.5 per cent. Its adjusted rate — taking out students who had left their course but enrolled in another — was only 3.74 per cent.
Universities Australia Deputy Chief Executive Catriona Jackson told news.com.au the attrition rates were no indictment on tertiary education providers. Rather, it was a “major achievement” that university access had been expanded to more Australians while keeping the dropout rate relatively stable.
“Research suggests attrition rates are higher for mature age and part-time students — and if you think about it, they’re the ones who may often be juggling university study with jobs, children and caring for elderly parents,” she said.
“Students battling disadvantage — including those who are first in their family to attend university — are also more likely to have thoughts about leaving.”
The experiences of disadvantaged students highlighted the importance of student support programs run by universities, which help students to find the support and resources they need to complete their degree, Ms Jackson said.
“The biggest factors for students who consider leaving university are often related to issues beyond university,” she said.
“They cite pressures with their health or stress, juggling work/life balance, the need to do paid work, their overall workload and financial difficulties among the top reasons for doing so.”
Grattan Institute higher education expert Andrew Norton told The Australian the attrition rates were worrying.
“The question is: are universities actually informing students of the risks they are taking on, particularly studying online, and are they being responsible in taking on students who are at high risk of not completing?”
The new data comes as the Federal Government awaits a report detailing recommendations about how best to make things clearer for students and keep them better informed.
The Higher Education Standards Panel, which is currently reviewing submissions over university admissions, has acknowledged greater transparency for students is needed to reshape higher education.

KIFI-TV,9/9/2016 0:58,"1,700-year-old obituary translated
Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
POSTED: 08:10 AM MDT Sep 08, 2016  UPDATED: 10:21 AM MDT Sep 08, 2016 
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Iowa State students' resolution asks Big 12 not to add BYU By Sean Walker | Posted Sep 8th, 2016 @ 7:02pm  1 photo  
PROVO — All had been pretty quiet on the Big 12 front as expansion candidates made their pitches for inclusion into the conference, including BYU. 
But the student government of one of the conference’s founding schools is speaking out. 
The Iowa State Student Senate passed a resolution Wednesday night arguing against BYU’s inclusion in the Big 12 because it “believes that BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12 Conference.” 
The language of the resolution is similar to a letter drafted by LGBT advocacy group Athlete Ally and other organizations last month in which it alleged BYU’s Honor Code explicitly discriminates against LGBTQ student-athletes. The ISU student government alleged similar discriminations in that BYU prohibits “sexual relations between members of the same sex, and all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings,” according to the resolution posted on the student government’s Facebook page. 
“Student government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed,” the senate said in a statement to the Ames (Iowa) Tribune . “The senate finds that Brigham Young University’s honor code does not communicate nor reflect the values that the Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the senate of student government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.” Related Story LGBTQ groups urge Big 12 not to add BYU in expansion Athlete Ally, a non-profit group of LGBTQ activists for sports league, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights released a letter Monday urging the Big 12 conference to not admit BYU as a member school because of what it believes to be discriminatory practices by the university and its sponsor, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins responded to the Athlete Ally letter at the time in an official statement from the university. 
“BYU welcomes as full members of the university community all whose conduct meets university standards,” the statement read. “We are very clear and open about our honor code, which all students understand and commit to when they apply for admission. One’s state sexual orientation is not an issue.” 
BYU athletic director Tom Holmoe also released a statement via Twitter at the time. 
“LGBT players, coaches and fans are always welcome to the BYU campus,” he said. “Everyone should be treated with respect, dignity and love.” 
Not everyone in the school’s student government voted in favor of the resolution. Student government president Cole Staudt argued the Student Senate should not pass the memorandum against BYU. 
“I have been speaking with other presidents of Big 12 institutions,” Staudt told the school newspaper Iowa State Daily . “A number of them said that they don’t believe we should be taking a position at all.” 
Staudt released a lengthy statement Thursday afternoon pertaining to the vote and BYU's potential inclusion in the Big 12. 
“BYU’s policies against the LGBT community are contrary to the community we desire in the United States. However, if we are truly committed to making change in this country and creating an inclusive nation, we cannot do it by excluding others,"" he said. 
“I believe that the most effective way to change what I see in BYU’s policies, is with love.” In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0 — ISU StuGov President (@ISUStuGovPres) September 8, 2016 
In all, 21 senators voted in favor of the resolution and six voted against it. The resolution will be sent to Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby and the conference’s expansion committee made up of the 10 university presidents. 
The conference continues to meet with 11 expansion candidates ranging from BYU, Cincinnati and Houston to Central Florida, Connecticut and Tulane this week in Dallas. 
The Cyclones were charter members of the Big 12 when it formed in 1994, supplanting the old Big Eight and Southwest conferences. The northernmost school in the Big 12, Iowa State has a 510-620-46 all-time record in football and a 3-9 record in postseason play. 
Iowa State has never won a Big 12 championship, though the Cyclones were Big 12 North champions in 2004, when they finished 7-5 with a 27-24 loss to TCU in the Houston Bowl. 
Iowa State opened the 2016 season with a 25-20 home loss to Northern Iowa. The Cyclones play at Iowa on Saturday. 
The Cougars are 0-4 all-time against Iowa State in four meetings between 1968 and 1974. Photos

thenewskenya,9/9/2016 1:02,"By VOA, Citizen Digital
Published on  9 September 2016
Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, appears to have a large area of dunes, according to new images released by the U.S. space agency.
The radar images came from NASA’s Cassini probe as it made a close flyby of Titan July 25, passing as near as 976 kilometers from the moon.
Also Read: U.S, Russian astronauts return to Earth After 6-Month space mission
NASA thinks the dunes are made up of “grains derived from hydrocarbons that have settled out of Titan’s atmosphere.” The dunes appear to circle most of Titan’s equator, and researchers say that they will be helpful in understanding winds on the moon.
“Dunes are dynamic features. They’re deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,” said Jani Radebaugh, a Cassini radar team associate at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.
Another image released by NASA shows an area on Titan called the “Xanadu annex,” a feature on the moon that appears “made up of the same type of mountainous terrains observed in Xanadu and scattered across other parts of Titan.”
Xanadu is the first surface feature to be spotted on Titan, having first been seen in 1994 by the Hubble Space Telescope.
“This ‘annex’ looks quite similar to Xanadu using our radar, but there seems to be something different about the surface there that masks this similarity when observing at other wavelengths, as with Hubble,” said Mike Janssen, also a Jet Propulsion Laboratory ((JPL)) member of the radar team. “It’s an interesting puzzle.”
NASA says the areas appear to be quite old.
“These mountainous areas appear to be the oldest terrains on Titan, probably remnants of the icy crust before it was covered by organic sediments from the atmosphere,” said Rosaly Lopes, a Cassini radar team member at JPL. “Hiking in these rugged landscapes would likely be similar to hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota.”
Cassini has now made 122 encounters with Titan since it arrived at Saturn in mid-2004. It is the last time the probe will examine the far southern regions of the moon.
“If Cassini were orbiting Earth instead of Saturn, this would be like getting our last close view of Australia,” said Stephen Wall, deputy lead of the Cassini radar team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
Cassini will now focus its flybys on liquid-filled lakes and seas found in the extreme north of the moon.Titan is the only other world astronomers know of that has stable liquid on its surface; but, instead of the water that drives Earth’s hydrocycle, Titan’s rivers, lakes, seas and oceans are filled with liquid hydrocarbons such as ethane and methane.
Cassini first confirmed the presence of liquid ethane in a lake called Ontario Lacus, in Titan’s southern hemisphere, during its 2008 flyby of the Saturnian moon.
Astrobiologists think the moon could have the chemical building blocks required for the creation of life.

Look for Mingus to win close one tonight vs. Cactus
Mingus Union High School football vs. Cactus, 7 p.m. Friday, Sept. 9
With consecutive losses to start the season, Mingus Union High School will host Cactus High School at 7 p.m. Friday. Said Mingus Head Coach Bob Young following the Marauders' 13-6 loss against Cactus Shadows, Friday's opponent is ""very physical and very good, and huge on the line.""
Though the Mingus offense hasn't quite found itself this year, the defense is beginning to tighten up on its opponents. Expect another close game this week - and a surprise first win of the year for the Marauders.
Final score: Mingus 20 Cactus 17
Camp Verde High School football is off this week. Next week, the Cowboys host Kingman Academy.
University of Arizona football vs. Grambling State, 7:45 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 10
Though the game was close, last week's University of Arizona season opener resulted in defeat for the Wildcats - an 18-16 loss to Brigham Young University at the Arizona Cardinals' home field in Glendale.
This week, the Wildcats host Grambling State University at Arizona Stadium in Tucson.
Just because U of A is the home team this week shouldn't cause them to get too cocky, as Grambling State beat Virginia University of Lynchburg last week by a score of 72-12.
The Wildcats will need to control both sides of the ball - and not take anything for granted - if they are to beat their opponent.
Final score: Wildcats 31 Grambling State 21,
Arizona State University football vs. Texas Tech, 7 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 10
Off a 44-13 drubbing of Northern Arizona University a week ago, Arizona State University will take on Texas Tech Saturday at Sun Devil Stadium.
Both the Sun Devils and the Red Raiders are 1-0 to start the season, as Texas Tech also won its season opener a week ago, 69-17 against Stephen F. Austin.
Final score: Sun Devils 38 Texas Tech 20
Northern Arizona University football vs. Western Illinois, 1 p.m. Saturday, Sept. 10
Northern Arizona University really didn't stand a chance last week against Arizona State University, losing 44-13 to the Sun Devils. This week, the Lumberjacks try to even their record as they play Western Illinois on the road.
Saturday's match won't be easy, as the Fighting Leathernecks defeated interstate rival Eastern Illinois 38-21 a week ago.
Though NAU is a pretty solid team, winning on the road against this solid squad is not likely. Though it will be close.
Final score: Western Illinois 28 Northern Arizona 27
Arizona Cardinals vs. New England Patriots, 5:30 p.m. Sunday, Sept. 11
With quarterback Tom Brady on the league's suspension list for the season's first four games, nobody really knows what to expect of Patriots' replacement signal caller Jimmy Garoppolo.
But it's safe to say what the Cardinals should be able to do. Score often, and keep the opponent from finding the end zone too many times.
Final score:Cardinals 31 Patriots 10
Arizona Diamondbacks vs. San Francisco Giants, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Sept. 9-11
At this point, it appears that the Arizona Diamondbacks are on cruise control, making vacation plans as they show up to their games just enough to almost make things interesting.
The return of A.J. Pollock from a busted elbow might have injected a little life into the team had it happened a few months back - or April, for that matter. Though he has been hitting, fielding and running well, the rest of the team seems pretty spent on this grossly disappointing season.
Speaking of disappointments, San Francisco was securely in first place at the all-star break. Since then, the Giants have kept company with the Diamondbacks, as they have watched the Clayton Kershaw-less Dodgers take the division lead.
Finishing a three-game set in LA-LA-Land, the Diamondbacks return home this weekend against San Francisco. Though the Giants are somehow not out of the race, all games count the next few weeks - the final few weeks of the season.
Diamondbacks win two of three against San Francisco.

Student Government President Cole Staudt speaks during the first Student Government meeting of the semester Aug. 24. Jessica Kalahar/Iowa State Daily 
Senator Danielle Nygard argues why she believes a bill should not be passed that would limit who could run for a seat in the Senate at the Government of the Student Body meeting on Wednesday, April 15. 
The first page of the BYU resolution. Student Government passes resolution against BYU joining Big 12 By Alex Connor, alex.connor@iowastatedaily.com and Linda Brown, linda.brown@iowastatedaily.com @len_duh Updated 12 Jessica Kalahar/Iowa State Daily 
Senator Danielle Nygard argues why she believes a bill should not be passed that would limit who could run for a seat in the Senate at the Government of the Student Body meeting on Wednesday, April 15. 
Student Government passed a resolution Wednesday night in opposition to Brigham Young University (BYU) possibly joining the Big 12 Conference. 
Sen. Abhijit Patwa introduced the resolution regarding BYU, arguing that Student Government should not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big 12 Conference at this time. 
The reason behind the resolution is that Patwa, and later Student Government, has determined that “BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12.” 
BYU has fallen under fire recently in regard to its Honor Code, which according to the resolution, the Honor Code “explicitly prohibits its students, staff and faculty from 'not only sexual relations between members of the same sex, but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings.'” 
BYU, located in Provo, Utah, and owned and operated by The Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints (LDS), has been near the top of the list of potential Big 12 expansion candidates. 
Patwa introduced the resolution to the Senate by citing an anecdote to Jack Trice, the first African-American athlete at Iowa State College. Trice died following a football game against the University of Minnesota in 1923, after sustaining injuries during the game. 
“[It is] widely accepted that the attack on Jack Trice was racially motivated,” Patwa said, further referencing that by passing this resolution that it’s time Student Government “take a stance to what we believe in.” 
Vice Speaker Conner Tillo furthered the debate, arguing that it’s their [Student Government’s] responsibility to advocate for their fellow Big 12 Universities. 
Student Government President Cole Staudt offered comments on the resolution, arguing against Patwa that he feels the Senate should not pass the BYU resolution. +2

“I have been speaking with other presidents of Big 12 institutions,"" Staudt said. ""A number of them said that they don’t believe we should be taking a position at all."" 
Staudt also said that while he does not agree with BYU’s honor code at all, he is in a struggle, stating that it might be somewhat hypocritical of Student Government to say that it can’t be a part of the Big 12 community. 
“You can’t change people by making them sit in the corner,” Staudt said. 
Sen. Zoey Shipley also countered the resolution and backed Staudt’s argument, saying that the conduct of BYU is based on its beliefs, and when students go to that school, they go there because of their beliefs. 
“It takes one student to say, ‘Wow, you don’t agree with them, you don’t agree with me,’” Shipley said. +2

Sen. Cody Woodruff, who was in support of passing the resolution, said he talked to a friend who has a relationship to BYU and said that students want this reform at their university. Many senators were hesitant in passing the resolution, however, because they felt it wasn’t their position or to make a statement at this time. 
Patwa later countered, saying, “I am a heterosexual male. I am not an athlete. This in no way affects me, but this problem is bigger than us.” 
Other senators felt that in passing the resolution, it gets in the way of free speech and the First Amendment. 
“I’m against this resolution ...,” said Sen. Eric Schultz. “[I] believe it’s a free speech issue, BYU has right to believe in what they want, and if you don’t like it, don’t go to their school.” 
One of the last arguments debated stemmed from whether the issue was timely, as the decision to whether BYU could enter the conference wouldn’t be decided until later in the semester. 
“There are many schools still in the running,” said Speaker Danielle Nygard. “Maybe this resolution is not the right time and place.” +2

After nearly an hour of debating over the specifics of the resolution, many senators found themselves heated over the topic. 
Leading into a recess, Staudt, who had been objected to speaking a second time during the meeting, began yelling at the Senate regarding the resolution. 
""I’m disappointed, I don’t have to be here. It’s [disrespectful] to say that you don’t have the time to listen to us,"" Staudt said, as about half of the senators left the room for a short break. 
“You make change by embracing people,” Staudt said. “...This resolution is not the way you make change. We don’t make change by excluding people. 
“You don’t say to a student, to me, that you can’t sit here for five more minutes.” 
Following the recess, Sen. Woodruff helped conclude arguments, saying, “BYU is inclusive, but discriminatory.” 
21 senators voted for the resolution, while six voted against. 
The resolution will be sent to Big 12 Conference Commissioner Bob Bowlsby, Baylor University Interim President David Garland, Iowa State University President Steven Leath, University of Kansas Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little, Kansas State University Interim President General Richard Myers, University of Oklahoma President David Boren, Oklahoma State University President Burns Hargis, University of Texas at Austin President Dr. Gregory Fenves, Texas Christian University Chancellor Victor Boschini Jr., Texas Tech University President Dr. Lawrence Schovanec, and West Virginia University President Dr. E. Gordon Gee. 
Also addressed at the meeting was the passing of a bill that will eliminate the monthly allocation process for funding. 
“Students need money now,” said Sen. Steven Valentino, while pushing to have the bill passed. 
By cutting the monthly allocation and streamlining it to a different process, it allows Student Government to better filter the funding process for student groups. 
According to the act, taking this process away can lower the risk of having to waive a second read due to a club or organization needing money in the immediate future when a request is replaced rather than the end of the month, which is thought to be inconvenient based on the need for the allocation. 
The removal of the monthly allocation process was passed in a majority vote by the Senate. 
The meeting concluded with closing comments, where Staudt apologized for interrupting the meeting, but said he was not sorry, and would do it again if the circumstances were all there. 
He reminded the Senate, however, that no matter what happens in the meetings, they’re all still friends and colleagues.

1,700-year-old obituary translated
Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
POSTED: 10:10 AM EDT Sep 08, 2016  UPDATED: 12:21 PM EDT Sep 08, 2016 
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

PROVO, Utah – BYU gymnastics released its 2017 schedule, including five home meets and a mixture of Mountain Rim Gymnastics Conference and nonconference meets throughout the season.
The nonconference schedule is highlighted by home meets against two Pac-12 opponents and both a home and away meet against two members of the Big Ten Conference. The Cougars will also compete in Texas, the home state of a few BYU gymnasts.
""I'm really excited that we're having more home meets,"" BYU head coach Guard Young said. ""The Arizona and Iowa teams that are coming in are going to be fun and different. We don't see them every single season.""
The annual Blue and White Intrasquad meet will be held Friday, Dec. 9, before the season kicks off. The Cougars open their season on Friday, Jan. 13, against in-state rival University of Utah at the Marriott Center.
""We're embracing hosting Utah opening weekend,"" Young said. ""What a cool way to start the season by bringing in such a high-profile team.""
BYU hosts Utah State the following week (Jan. 20) before heading to the Gem State Invitational in Boise (Jan. 27).
February competition begins with two away meets, including a tri-meet against Utah State and Denver in Logan (Feb. 3). The Cougars then travel to Texas Woman's University (Feb. 11) before returning to Provo for a pair of home meets. BYU hosts Southern Utah (Feb. 18) and Iowa (Feb. 24). The month ends with a trip to Southern Utah on Feb. 27.
The Cougars compete against Minnesota in Minneapolis (March 4) before coming home to face Arizona (March 10) in the final regular season meet. The MRCG championships will be held March 18 at Utah State.

powertobecome,9/9/2016 1:19,"Through this short, mortal life, each of us are given experiences to help us grow, progress, and in turn bring us closer to our Heavenly Father. Our ultimate desire is to become like Him, thus we are given individually tailored trials to strengthen our weaknesses so that in time, we too can become perfect. My story is not any more remarkable that your story. Each of us are given our own mountains to climb to teach us more about ourselves and to help us discover our divine identity within our souls. I hope you find healing, hope and added measures of faith as you read through my thoughts, impressions and insights that the Lord has asked me to share. Energy work has not only become part of me, but I believe it is a divine gift and mission that I have been blessed with to help heal others and bring them closer to our loving Father in Heaven. I am living proof of the love our Heavenly Father has for each of us and the personal relationship and interest He has in our lives, our happiness, and our progression. As you read my story below, I pray that the spirit will testify its truthfulness and also the power that YOU have within yourself to also unlock the blessings and healing powers that God so anxiously wants to give you. He can heal your sorrows and help you to move forward, taking life as it comes and welcoming all God has planned to make you a better person.
_____________________________________________________________
I graduated from Brigham Young University with my degree in Exercise Science. As a senior in high school, making the decision on what major I would study in college was really difficult. I have wide spread passions that spread from mathematics and astronomy to dance and food science. As college approached, after much prayer and pondering, I felt that Exercise Science was where I needed to study. Through the next five years, I discovered a passion I never knew existed within me. I discovered the magnificent human anatomy and physiology that made me who I am. My body was my text book and as I learned about deep processes I got so excited because it all made sense and helped me appreciate my body and spirit. My freshman year of college I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease, a genetic disease that at the time was very rare. I found my knowledge expanding even more as I had to teach myself what foods I could and couldn't eat and how to nurse my sick body back to health. Through the next 6 years, more and more passions unveiled themselves. I became obsessed with cooking and getting creative with my clean eating meals. I started teaching fitness classes, Personal Training, and working as a Corporate Health & Fitness Specialist. I fell in love with this position because it incorporated all of my passions into one job: helping people to find their best self, thus enabling them to enjoy the best life they could imagine.
 
As I began working in the Corporate Wellness world, I started noticing an underlying issue with hundreds and hundreds of my clients. Each of them were experiencing noticeable physical aliments and limitations that worsened or manifested themselves as situations, relationships, or experiences in their lives began to fall apart or take turns for ""the worse"". Though I was still doing a lot of meal coaching and personal training, I found that 90% of my time was being spent listening to these wonderful people who came to me in search of answers.
As the oldest of six children, and the only girl, I've always been the ""mothering"" type. I want to heal everyone I came in contact with and make everything better. No matter what stage I've been in life, I was always the friend everyone came to with their problems. I listened and sometimes offered advice, but mostly just encouraged them and cheered them on when life was difficult. Amidst all the helping, unbeknownst to me, I was stuffing and literally hiding from my own emotions and hardships in life. I found myself focusing on everyone and their problems, going to great lengths to help them and feeling extremely fatigued when I realized I couldn't solve every thing. But little did I know that all the focus outward, was causing a lot of problems inwardly. I was neglecting my own soul. I was ignoring my own problems. I was giving all my personal power to these individuals, tirelessly trying to help them, instead of understanding the role that Christ should have been playing in their lives.
As I started to turn to my Savior, pleading for an answer on how to heal myself, and others, I started finding little answers here and there that in time led me down the road I am on today. I was introduced to energy work - and became very skeptical at first. I was familiar with physical and nutritional healing because I could SEE the results, but believing in energy work scared me because I could not see it. Feeling very strong impressions to try it, I started seeing a lady who I now know the Lord led me to as an answer to many, many prayers. Over the course of 3 sessions, my allergies disappeared. I had struggled with eating gluten, lactose, soy, and sugar for many years - to the point where I often ended up in hospitals, writhing and screaming in pain. I had to go to great lengths, as did those around me, to make sure there was healthy food I could eat that wasn't contaminated and that would make me sick. Though these years were trying, I never saw it as a burden nor a trial to be released from. It was during these sessions that the Lord introduced me to a whole new world and level of healing - a world that involved healing on a spiritual, mental and emotional level. As I started to understand the role that emotions play in our health, along with personal power, healthy boundaries, along with understanding the power of the Atonement on a deeper level, I started to make changes in my life that changed my thought patterns, and thus, my reality. I was literally ""stomaching"" my problems, along with the problems of others, and it was causing a lot of physical ailments. Soon my allergies, my pain, and the ""heaviness"" that I had been carrying around with me for years, were gone. I gradually started to understand the power of thoughts and how thoughts do determine our destiny.
Because of this miracle that took place in my life - I started to look at all the physical problems around me - allergies, injuries, chest pains, asthma, depression, etc. - very differently. I began reading anything and everything I could get my hands on and diving deeper and deeper into scriptural accounts about faith and healing. The Lord was very present in my life, as He is now, and was constantly teaching me as I went. I soon discovered that everything is created spiritually before it is created physically, including all our illnesses. I continued to pray for help to develop this gift, and was led to many different classes and programs that constantly taught me more and more and more. Soon I was healing many members of my family and friends by helping them to understand the root problems of their physical ailments and helping them turn their heavy loads over to the Savior for safe keeping.
It was about a year after all this started when I underwent a rough divorce. At the time, this was the hardest thing I had ever experienced, and with it came a wide array of emotions and heartache. I continued to keep the Lord close, and used the many things He had taught me about energy work and emotions to keep my testimony strong, and be able to press forward in faith instead of being paralyzed by the situation. Because of the relationship I had built on my Savior, I was often very calm in the midst of chaos. I was indeed grateful for the many experiences leading up to this time where I had been delivered, healed, and blessed.
I started this website soon after my divorce after receiving a very strong prompting that my challenges at the time would be used later on to help heal others from their trials. Though I am no talented writer, the Lord has helped me to know what I need to write about and share on this website. I thought about taking down some of my earlier posts that talked about my dating and marrying Skyler, the greatest blessing God has ever given me, but I felt very strongly to leave it up because it is part of my story. It has helped shaped who I am today.
The name of this website came very clearly one day, when I was praying about what to call it. I had been doing a lot of energy work on myself with a dear friend because I was struggling with a lot of health ailments once again. My allergies were returning, along with other physical problems. As we worked on me, I found an underlying problem to all my issues . . . I was trying to move forward, but I was too busy looking back into the past. I was focused on the pain I had experienced, the sadness, the heartache, and was victimizing myself from some traumatic experiences I had while being married before. Much like Lot's wife in the Bible, I was so focused on my past, that I was blind to the blessings God was trying to give me, and was preventing my own personal healing and growth. I had one foot pointed towards the future, but my other foot was spiritually pointing backwards towards my past - and it was causing an internal struggle of where to go and confusing me with what I was supposed to be doing at the present time. Thus, I was told to name this Both Feet Forward because no healing or progression can occur unless we are willing to ""drop our nets, and follow Him."" wholeheartedly.
Each physical trial we go through is there to teach us something. Every time I need help, the Savior shows me what I need to work on and what He needs me to do in order to prepare myself to further my progression and His work. If we are so focused on the past, ""what ifs"" or ""I should have ..."" then He cannot use us to build His kingdom. Only the adversary will break us with thoughts from the past and taunt us with mistakes, inadequacies or regrets. The Atonement is real. It is powerful. It gives us the ability to heal from whatever it is we are going through, and to come out better than we were before.
Too often we let other's take the reins to our own happiness (the adversary included) and lose the ability to stand in our own power. By giving up your personal power, you not only lose your confidence, but you lose sight of who you are and what your purpose is here in this life. By living in the here and now, we keep our personal power where it belongs. You can stay strong and push through when times are hard because the Savior will never, ever, leave you alone. As energy work has blessed my life, I pray that you will open your heart and let it bless yours. This is a sacred work that I believe God has given us to help us grow closer to Him and to teach us more of our divine missions here on earth. No matter what you have gone through, what emotions you have experienced, or pains that at times seem unbearable, God is there. He understands. He loves you. He wants you to come to Him, and to allow Him to make you whole. As you do this, not only will your personal relationship and faith in Him increase, but you too will discover your purpose, your passion and find an inner power to press on when times are hard. It's never too late to start over and work towards a new you and a new life.

Prestigious College or Major: Which Pays off More?
Careers
University attrition rates: Why are so many students dropping out?
Liz Burke, news.com.au
September 9, 2016 7:48am
FIRST year university students are leaving their original chosen courses at a higher rate than ever.
New data shows about one in five commencing bachelor students left their original course in 2014, and about 15 per cent dropped out completely.
The figures also see the increase in the number of students not completing their chosen course climb to more than one million for the first time.
Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, are defending the figures. They point out that while overall attrition rates are up, when it comes to the percentage of students dropping out of university completely in their first year (the adjusted attrition rate), the average figure is similar to past years, sticking at around 15 per cent for the past decade.
But the number of students leaving their first year courses is increasing — whether they find another place for themselves in the higher education system or not.
At the university with the worst attrition rate, the University of Tasmania, 42.26 per cent of first year students left their course during the first year, with most of those — 38.13 per cent of all first year students — dropped out of university altogether.
The University of Melbourne had the lowest attrition rate at 7.5 per cent. Its adjusted rate — taking out students who had left their course but enrolled in another — was only 3.74 per cent.
Universities Australia Deputy Chief Executive Catriona Jackson told news.com.au the attrition rates were no indictment on tertiary education providers. Rather, it was a “major achievement” that university access had been expanded to more Australians while keeping the dropout rate relatively stable.
“Research suggests attrition rates are higher for mature age and part-time students — and if you think about it, they’re the ones who may often be juggling university study with jobs, children and caring for elderly parents,” she said.
“Students battling disadvantage — including those who are first in their family to attend university — are also more likely to have thoughts about leaving.”
The experiences of disadvantaged students highlighted the importance of student support programs run by universities, which help students to find the support and resources they need to complete their degree, Ms Jackson said.
“The biggest factors for students who consider leaving university are often related to issues beyond university,” she said.
“They cite pressures with their health or stress, juggling work/life balance, the need to do paid work, their overall workload and financial difficulties among the top reasons for doing so.”
Grattan Institute higher education expert Andrew Norton told The Australian the attrition rates were worrying.
“The question is: are universities actually informing students of the risks they are taking on, particularly studying online, and are they being responsible in taking on students who are at high risk of not completing?”
The new data comes as the Federal Government awaits a report detailing recommendations about how best to make things clearer for students and keep them better informed.
The Higher Education Standards Panel, which is currently reviewing submissions over university admissions, has acknowledged greater transparency for students is needed to reshape higher education.

Spencer Yamada BYU,9/9/2016 1:30,"
Studying integrity to make the world a better place Spencer Yamada BYU Courtesy Stephanie Bogdan 
Dr. Marc-Charles Ingerson. 
Sure, it seems like a lofty goal: the promise of a better world simply by studying how people can act with more integrity. 
One researcher at Brigham Young University believes that a deeper awareness of meaningful attributes like honesty, empathy and courage can make the world better, and he is ambitious enough to take on that goal. Dr. Marc-Charles Ingerson is a scholar affiliated with Brigham Young University’s Wheatley Institution. He is conducting research on integrity and the role it plays in everyday life. 
Traditionally, integrity has been defined as the ability of an individual to match their words to their actions, but this definition has serious problems, Ingerson said. For example, a person could commit to robbing a bank and complete the action. Under the old definition, this could be considered integrity. 
“Honesty is not integrity,” Ingerson said. “Authenticity is not integrity. I can be honest and … living a lie.” 
Ingerson believes integrity has an ethical component that must be better understood. This will require a shift in how researchers conduct studies on human behavior. Scholars have thought a lot about what qualities matter most in a person, but not enough work has been done to define the qualities themselves. 
“It started in business ethics,” Ingerson said. “A lot has been said on what matters, but a lot needs to be done to define, operationalize and predict behavior among the virtues that matter.” 
Once virtues are understood and explicitly defined, Ingerson said, related behavior could be more accurately predicted and even improved. 
Last year, Ingerson published an article in Harvard Law School’s Negotiation Journal with Dr. Kristen DeTienne and Dr. Katie Liljenquist called, “Beyond Instrumentalism: A Relational Approach to Negotiation.” This article was a first step for Ingerson to starting a new conversation about integrity and to create a space for these new ideas to spread. 
Previously, negotiation research focused on self-interest, such as getting what you want without losing anything, said Ingerson. Instead, he and his co-authors looked at instances where people care about the well-being of the other party. 
One example of this is two friends deciding which movie to watch. Each person has their own preference and also cares that the other person gets what they want. When one friend uses negotiation to help the other, they are negotiating with integrity. Ingerson said that we do this all the time, but scholarship hasn’t yet acknowledged it. 
The next aspect to study, said Ingerson, is how the role of integrity is introduced into other areas like human resources and training. Work that outlines how to develop and increase integrity could lead to better results in the workplace for both managers and employees. Teachers instructing future generations, engineers designing products, volunteers working with humanitarian aid organizations and more will benefit from a real understanding of integrity. 
“As business faculty it’s our responsibility to demonstrate not only that what we are doing matters to our colleges academically and our students institutionally, but also to our community of practitioners,” he said. “It needs to be practical; it needs to work.” 
Ingerson’s research implies that human beings are not static with fixed characteristics, but are dynamic and moldable. It means that everyone can develop integrity and other virtues, he said. 
“We want to get it out to the general public that we can change,” Ingerson said. “We can change for the better and here are some things to focus on.” Tags

1,700-year-old obituary translated
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published On: Sep 08 2016 09:10:15 AM CDT Updated On: Sep 08 2016 11:21:52 AM CDT
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

The BECU Foundation has awarded $3,000 college scholarships to Kent's Maria Namuddu and Sydney Walker.
They're among 80 students to receive the award. Scholarship recipients were chosen based on their academic performance and passion for helping others, through volunteering. Since 1995, the BECU Foundation has awarded more than $2.2 million in scholarships to 950 student members.
Namuddu, a Washington State University student studying nursing, volunteered at a food drive at the Salvation Army in Renton where she sorted out donated food.
""When I was in Africa we had a problem of hunger. Knowing what it means to go without food, this inspired me to volunteer in the hunger food drive at the Salvation Army in Renton,"" she said. ""From this service I learned that hunger is an issue around the world and it is up to us to help those in need. Together as one we can overcome the hunger problem and make the world a better place to live.""
Walker, a Brigham Young University student studying communications, served in Arizona as a missionary, reaching out to others by comforting them and proselytizing.
""I realized that people are more alike than they are different. Service and love can overcome any supposed difference we might think we have with others,"" Walker said. ""I talked with people who had struggled with depression and suicide, lost loved ones and lost jobs. People are resilient. People are strong. People can find joy in any circumstance. In watching people overcome these challenges and devastating moments, I too found joy. Joy came to me, as I derived my purpose from putting other people's challenges above my own.""
Elsewhere
Kent's Emily Church, Shaun Fisher, Katlin Martin and Sarah Zeitler have been named to the Whitworth University Provost's honor roll for spring semester. ... Kent's Jonathan Gildart graduated with honors (cum laude) from Adams State University (Alamosa, Colo.) with a degree in business administration. ...

“He’s the reason that I’m here now,” Cameron said.
Indeed, if it hadn’t been for Pete Carroll, chances are Cameron never would have played college football, therefore never would have played in the NFL.
Remember that Cameron was a basketball player at Brigham Young University when he started playing college sports, but that changed when he went out to run…

KSL.com,9/9/2016 1:55,"PROVO — All had been pretty quiet on the Big 12 front as expansion candidates made their pitches for inclusion into the conference, including BYU.
But the student government of one of the conference’s founding schools is speaking out.
The Iowa State Student Senate passed a resolution Wednesday night arguing against BYU’s inclusion in the Big 12 because it 'believes that BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12 Conference.'
The language of the resolution is similar to a letter drafted by LGBT advocacy group Athlete Ally and other organizations last month in which it alleged BYU’s Honor Code explicitly discriminates against LGBTQ student-athletes. The ISU student government alleged similar discriminations in that BYU prohibits 'sexual relations between members of the same sex, and all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings,' according to the resolution posted on the student government’s Facebook page.
'Student government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed,' the senate said in a statement to the Ames (Iowa) Tribune . 'The senate finds that Brigham Young University’s honor code does not communicate nor reflect the values that the Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the senate of student government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.'
Related Story
Athlete Ally, a non-profit group of LGBTQ activists for sports league, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights released a letter Monday urging the Big 12 conference to not admit BYU as a member school because of what it believes to be discriminatory practices by the university and its sponsor, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins responded to the Athlete Ally letter at the time in an official statement from the university.
'BYU welcomes as full members of the university community all whose conduct meets university standards,' the statement read. 'We are very clear and open about our honor code, which all students understand and commit to when they apply for admission. One’s state sexual orientation is not an issue.'
BYU athletic director Tom Holmoe also released a statement via Twitter at the time.
'LGBT players, coaches and fans are always welcome to the BYU campus,' he said. 'Everyone should be treated with respect, dignity and love.'
Not everyone in the school’s student government voted in favor of the resolution. Student government president Cole Staudt argued the Student Senate should not pass the memorandum against BYU.
'I have been speaking with other presidents of Big 12 institutions,' Staudt told the school newspaper Iowa State Daily . 'A number of them said that they don’t believe we should be taking a position at all.'
Staudt released a lengthy statement Thursday afternoon pertaining to the vote and BYU's potential inclusion in the Big 12.
'BYU’s policies against the LGBT community are contrary to the community we desire in the United States. However, if we are truly committed to making change in this country and creating an inclusive nation, we cannot do it by excluding others,"" he said.
'I believe that the most effective way to change what I see in BYU’s policies, is with love.'
In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0
- ISU StuGov President (@ISUStuGovPres) September 8, 2016
In all, 21 senators voted in favor of the resolution and six voted against it. The resolution will be sent to Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby and the conference’s expansion committee made up of the 10 university presidents.
The conference continues to meet with 11 expansion candidates ranging from BYU, Cincinnati and Houston to Central Florida, Connecticut and Tulane this week in Dallas.
The Cyclones were charter members of the Big 12 when it formed in 1994, supplanting the old Big Eight and Southwest conferences. The northernmost school in the Big 12, Iowa State has a 510-620-46 all-time record in football and a 3-9 record in postseason play.
Iowa State has never won a Big 12 championship, though the Cyclones were Big 12 North champions in 2004, when they finished 7-5 with a 27-24 loss to TCU in the Houston Bowl.
Iowa State opened the 2016 season with a 25-20 home loss to Northern Iowa. The Cyclones play at Iowa on Saturday.
The Cougars are 0-4 all-time against Iowa State in four meetings between 1968 and 1974.

1,700-year-old obituary translated
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published On: Sep 08 2016 10:10:15 AM EDT Updated On: Sep 08 2016 12:21:52 PM EDT
Jaren Wilkey/BYU via CNN
(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

cellarspider,9/9/2016 2:09,"Titan's Dunes and Other Features Emerge in New Images
spaceexp:
NASA & ESA - Cassini-Huygens Mission to Saturn & Titan patch.Sept. 7, 2016New scenes from a frigid alien landscape are coming to light in recent radar images of Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, from NASA’s Cassini spacecraft.Cassini obtained the views during a close flyby of Titan on July 25, when the spacecraft came as close as 607 miles (976 kilometers) from the giant moon. The spacecraft’s radar instrument is able to penetrate the dense, global haze that surrounds Titan, to reveal fine details on the surface.
Dunes of Shangri-La on Saturn’s Moon Titan
Video above: NASA’s Cassini spacecraft has radar vision that allows it to peer through the haze that surrounds Saturn’s largest moon, Titan. This video focuses on Shangri-la, a large, dark area on Titan filled with dunes. The long, linear dunes are thought to be comprised of grains derived from hydrocarbons that have settled out of Titan’s atmosphere. Video Credits: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.One of the new views (along with a short video) shows long, linear dunes, thought to be comprised of grains derived from hydrocarbons that have settled out of Titan’s atmosphere. Cassini has shown that dunes of this sort encircle most of Titan’s equator. Scientists can use the dunes to learn about winds, the sands they’re composed of, and highs and lows in the landscape.“Dunes are dynamic features. They’re deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,” said Jani Radebaugh, a Cassini radar team associate at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah.Another new image shows an area nicknamed the “Xanadu annex” earlier in the mission by members of the Cassini radar team. Cassini’s radar had not previously obtained images of this area, but earlier measurements by the spacecraft suggested the terrain might be quite similar to the large region on Titan named Xanadu.
Image above: This synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) image was obtained by NASA’s Cassini spacecraft on July 25, 2016, during its “T-121” pass over Titan’s southern latitudes. Image Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASI/Université Paris-Diderot.First imaged in 1994 by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, Xanadu was the first surface feature to be recognized on Titan. While Hubble was able to see Xanadu’s outline, the annex area went unnoticed.The new Cassini image reveals that the Xanadu annex is, indeed, made up of the same type of mountainous terrains observed in Xanadu and scattered across other parts of Titan.“This ‘annex’ looks quite similar to Xanadu using our radar, but there seems to be something different about the surface there that masks this similarity when observing at other wavelengths, as with Hubble,” said Mike Janssen, also a JPL member of the radar team. “It’s an interesting puzzle.”Xanadu – and now its annex – remains something of a mystery. Elsewhere on Titan, mountainous terrain appears in small, isolated patches, but Xanadu covers a large area, and scientists have proposed a variety of theories about its formation.
Image above: Hundreds of sand dunes are visible as dark lines snaking across the surface. Image Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASI/Université Paris-Diderot.“These mountainous areas appear to be the oldest terrains on Titan, probably remnants of the icy crust before it was covered by organic sediments from the atmosphere,” said Rosaly Lopes, a Cassini radar team member at JPL. “Hiking in these rugged landscapes would likely be similar to hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota.”The July 25 flyby was Cassini’s 122nd encounter with Titan since the spacecraft’s arrival in the Saturn system in mid-2004. It was also the last time Cassini’s radar will image terrain in the far southern latitudes of Titan.“If Cassini were orbiting Earth instead of Saturn, this would be like getting our last close view of Australia,” said Stephen Wall, deputy lead of the Cassini radar team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.
Cassini Titan flyby. Image Credits: NASA/JPL-Caltech
Cassini’s four remaining Titan flybys will focus primarily on the liquid-filled lakes and seas in Titan’s far north. The mission will begin its finale in April 2017, with a series of 22 orbits that plunge between the planet and its icy rings.The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (European Space Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, Washington. JPL designed, developed and assembled the Cassini orbiter. The radar instrument was built by JPL and the Italian Space Agency, working with team members from the U.S. and several European countries.More information about Cassini:http://www.nasa.gov/cassinihttp://saturn.jpl.nasa.govhttp://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Cassini-HuygensImages (mentioned), Video (mentioned), Text, Credits: NASA/Tony Greicius/JPL/Preston Dyches.Greetings, Orbiter.chFull article",http://cellarspider.tumblr.com/,https://tmblr.co/ZrqAfv2BrV9XG,en,TRUE,0,0,Tumblr,Positive,,,,,,,,tb-150115390400,mazarinedrake,https://tmblr.co/ZinqIx2BpanF0,,0,0

Will Burchfield,9/9/2016 2:14,"By Will Burchfield,  @burchie_kid
In Jim Caldwell’s eyes, it’s pretty easy to grasp the special ability of Ziggy Ansah.
'All you do is take a look at the film – you look at practice film, even – and he does things that no one else does. He has some very unusual traits and characteristics,' Caldwell said.
Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck, who’s been studying the Lions’ defense in preparation for Sunday’s game, would agree.
'They can obviously rush the passer, with Ansah especially. He’s a special, special player,' Luck said in a conference call on Wednesday.
Ansah, a relative unknown when he entered the NFL in 2013, has blossomed into a bonafide star. He finished third in the league last year with 14.5 sacks – just a half-sack shy of the Lions’ single season record – and was rewarded with a trip to the Pro Bowl.
'That’s quite an honor and that tells you right there that he’s one of the best in the league,' Caldwell said.
But the Lions’ coach still thinks the 27-year-old defensive end has room to improve.
'I certainly do, and I think you’ll see that. If he can stay healthy you’ll see an even better version of him because he’s really just starting to scratch the surface of all of the things that he’s capable of doing within the context of our scheme,' Caldwell said.
Ansah finds himself in rarefied air. He is soaring into superstardom, yet the sky remains the limit. He can still get better, even while being one of the best.
The NFL’s upper echelon of defensive players? That’s not really a target anymore.
'I like to think he’s already there,' said defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. 'I think he just has to keep improving. I’m not looking for any numbers or anything like that.'
Ansah’s dad is, though. He’s pushing his son to break 15 sacks this season and write his name into the Lions’ record books.
Reminded of that on Thursday, Ansah smiled and downplayed the idea of aiming for certain statistics.
'Nobody ever puts numbers to the work that I do,' he said. 'I just try to improve on the previous year and that’s the best I can do.'
In that case, one reporter pointed out, 15 sacks should be his minimum target.
'Thank you,' Ansah deadpanned, before breaking into a laugh. 'Good job.'
Ansah’s ascent is startling given his background. The Ghana native didn’t begin playing football until his sophomore year at Brigham Young University and didn’t make much of an impact on the field until his senior year.
You’d hardly know that watching him now.
'He’s a guy that didn’t play from the time he was 8, 9, 10 years like a lot of guys, but he has all the necessary tools to be outstanding and he has a real nasty streak in him, which is something that I think makes a tremendous difference' said Caldwell.
The coach grinned when he mentioned Ansah’s viciousness on the gridiron.
'That’s the way you play the game and he does it well,' Caldwell said.
Austin went a step further.
'This guy is as fine a football player as I’ve been around,' he said.
Asked for his thoughts on receiving such praise, the poker-faced Ansah responded in typically subtle fashion.
'I appreciate you, Teryl,' he said.

LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION, SHALL WE? 
COMPLETELY TESTED!!!
 ~ON 8/2/2016 (CLEAN AND CLEAR). So, have you ever got yourself tested at all???
The only one girl with “The best magic” of All…
‘The one & only cleanest , healthiest than yo’momma, yo’ wife , yo’ gf and you, combined….”
I GOT TESTED (BLOOD & URINE) & SWAB FOR MOUTH, ASS, WITH ALL COMPLETE ADVANCE LAB TEST, FOR ALL STDs/ HIV, Hep C etc (CLEAN AND CLEAR).
AND I’M ON PrEP ~ ( Meaning: Stds free and hiv free and no hepatitis A, B & C. And you can only be on PrEP if you have been completely tested, STDs FREE, NO health issues whatsoever (esp. liver, kidney & bones) and PrEP can only be prescribed by your doctor. If you’re HIV positive, you can’t be on PrEP (too little too late, the ship has sailed- And Oh Danny boy starts to play Uh Oh..). 
AND GET VACCINATED FOR:
1.PNEUMOCOCCAL 23-VALENT,
2.HPV (get the gardasil9 - New HPV Vaccine)
3.TDAP,
4.MENINGOCOCCAL
5. PLUS, IMMUNE OF HEPATITIS A/B TOO..
6. GOT MY COLONOSCOPY & COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS ETC..
DO YOU KNOW? VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. WELL, NOW YO DO…
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT ??
“THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE , THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD TO BANG, FIRST OF ALL, ON PrEP AND EARLY VACCINATIONS, AT LEAST  FOR EARLY HPV & HEPATITIS  (All 3 doses). There’s a newest HPV vaccine, gardasil9.
Three types of pathogens of concern, are Hepatitis , Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is much more contagious than HIV.  While HPV is the easiest and most common one, transmitted among people who are late to get the vaccines or never have the vaccines.There’s no cure for HPV & Condom do not protect you against Hepatitis & HPV at all, but Only early vaccinations do. Most of the guys, girls, gays, ts and bi, (you see or have been with), have either one or both or three of those pathogens. If they never get their early vaccinations or they’re late or never get tested for HIV (and/or NOT on PrEP). A Lot of people don’t even know what they have or not aware of them.
NOTE:
AND THE MORE, THE GIRLS/GUYS ARE POPULAR &  MANY GUYS OR PEOPLE FLOCK TO THEM, THE MORE VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS THAT THEY HAVE. JUST PICTURE EACH GUY CHIPS IN WITH THEIR OWN STRAIN OF VIRUSES (HPV, HEP, HIV). SO, COUNT HOW MANY GUYS? 1? 10? 100?,  LET’S TAKE HPV FOR INSTANCE. DO YOU KNOW 14 MILLIONS NEW PEOPLE GET INFECTED BY HPV IN THE U.S EVERY YEAR (PER CDC). (THEY COULD BE YOUR TRICKS, HOOK UP FRIENDS, GIRLS/BOYS, GAYS, ESCORTS, SOMEONE’S HUSBAND/ WIFE) ETC. (VICIOUS CYCLE - KEEP ON MULTIPLYING…) 👀🙃
AND OF COURSE, “IF”~ IF THEY NEVER HAVE EARLY VACCINATIONS & IF THEY ARE NOT ON PREP. OR THEY NEVER HAVE VACCINATIONS AT ALL OR “LATE”. SOME MONSTERS ALREADY GOT IN THERE MMMM THAT’S RIGHT, SUGAH TITS. A DAY LATE & A DOLLAR SHORT… BUT IF YOU GOT VACCINATED  (HPV, HEPATITIS ETC) SINCE YOU’RE 13 - 15 LIKE ME, YOU’RE GOOD. WELL, YOU’RE JUST MMM SLUTTY. THE BIGGEST SLUT OF ALL, AREN’T YOU? YES YOU ARE..😄
AND AGAIN, ANYONE CAN SAY THEY HAD OR HAVE/ARE, BUT NO PROOF A.K.A “BLOWING SMOKE”. DON’T GET FOOLED BY THAT CRAP. IT’S A TREND MANY GIRLS OR GUYS USE NOWADAYS. (FOR EXAMPLE. DID YOU SEE THE BOTTLES OF PREP (TRUVADA) THEY HAVE TAKEN PRESCRIBED ON THEIR NAMES? (WELL, WELL, WELL LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN, A PINOCCHIOOO…) 😉
IF YOU’RE ON PrEP, THAT’S VERY GOOD.  BUT IF YOU DON’T GET VACCINATED FOR HPV & HEPATITIS. YOUR PROTECTION IS NOT COMPLETE. HPV & HEPATITIS ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEM (teenagers, girls, boys, men, women, gay, bi, straight -everyone really without early vaccinations) - (The main cause of CERVICAL CANCER, ANAL CANCER, COCK, BALLS, MOUTH, THROAT CANCER, LIVER CYST, LIVER CIRRHOSIS, LIVER CANCER ETC). MANY HAVE HPV & HEPATITIS AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM, AND AGAIN HIV TOO.
PLUS MEN CAN BE CARRIERS OF THESE HPV VIRUSES (OF ANY TYPES). As CDC states, “Many men who get HPV(of any types) might not develop symptoms and the infection for a while (It’s like a ticking bomb), and become “the carriers”, spreading around everywhere (their spouse, partners, hook-ups/tricks, girls, boys, gays, escorts, massage parlors etc). However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, colons, Vagina, vulva, cervix,  mouth, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)”.
“CONDOMS DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM HPV VIRUSES & HEPATITIS A,B & C, ONLY EARLY VACCINES DO”. IF YOU’RE LATE TO GET THE HPV VACCINES, YOU’RE LATE TO THOSE HPV VIRUSES, YOU HAVE GOT. ONCE YOU GET THE HPV (OF ANY TYPES), IT STAYS, IN YOU FOREVER. AND CONDOMS CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU FROM HIV UP TO 70%, WITH 30% RISK. NEW MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH TO PEVENT HIV IS  “PrEP”.
According to CDC, Vaccine-preventable diseases cause long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death.Did You Know that?
Each year In the United States:1. Each year, an average of 226,000 people are hospitalized due to influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die of influenza and its complications, the majority are among adults.2. There were approximately 32,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2012. Of those cases, there were about 3,300 deaths.3. 800,000 to 1.4 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, with complications such as liver cancer.4. In the U.S., HPV causes about 17,000 cancers in women, and about 9,000 cancers in men each year. About 10,000 die each year from HPV related cancers.
5. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 50 men will receive a diagnosis of HIV infection at some point in their lifetimes. Over the course of their lifetimes, 1 in 15 black men/women will be diagnosed with HIV infection, as will 1 in 18 Hispanic/ Latino men/women, 1 in 25 white men/women, 1 in 30  Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander men/women,  1 in 50 American Indian/Alaska Native men/women. 
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT?? 
Did you ever kiss, lick, touch, suck, drink, sex (vagina, ass, oral), with other girl, guy, ts, escorts or anyone who do not get their early vaccinations and/or on PrEP ? If you did or do, you just have to. 
Only complete advance lab test (blood, urine & swabs) will let you know for sure. It’s better to know your body & health than Not. Only a fool ignores his own body or health. No matter whom you’re with (gf, bf, hook-ups, someone’s gf, bf, wife, husband, tricks,1 nightstand, college friends, gay, bi, straight, escorts, porn stars, massage parlors etc), in any intimate event involve with:
 1.Skin touching skin ~HPV (hands, lips, genitals, massages etc), and 
2.Body fluids ~Hep A,B & C (saliva, pre-cum, cum etc), or 
3. Sex, oral or penetration ~ HIV, HPV & Hep ( oral, rim, penetrations, cock, vagina, handjob etc).
AND TO GO ON WITH THE STORY, MMM COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BECOOOOS THEY CAN PREVENT CANCERS. ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

#ColinKaepernickSyllabus | New Black Man in Exile
On September 4, Rebecca Martinez tweeted Louis Moore and David J. Leonard, suggesting the creation of Colin Kaepernick Syllabus. Soon, we, along with  Bijan C. Bayne, Sarah J. Jackson, and many others began the work of creating a syllabus to hopefully elevate and empower the conversations that Colin Kaepernick started when he decided to sit down in protest during an August 26, 2016 preseason game.  
Building on the framework established by Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha Blain, with their monumental #CharlestonSyllabus, Marcia Chatelain with #FergusonSyllabus and subsequent efforts from Candice Benbow with #LemonadeSyllabus and others who have sought to not only use social media and online technology to crowdsource and aggregate conversations, this syllabus represents an effort to bring  together multiple conversations, histories, disciplines, discourses, and spaces.  If we are going to follow Colin Kaepernick’s lead to have conversations and work toward justice, we must do so with the necessary tools and collective understanding.  This requires engaging multiple conversations, entering into these spaces with a historic foundation, with knowledge about the persistent realities of racial injustice and inequality, with insight into the longstanding struggles of the Black athlete.  This syllabus represents an attempt to aid in these conversations, to turn our everyday conversations, debates, and discourse into a classroom, all while making sure our institutionalized classrooms are engaged with the histories, struggles, and public discourses that shape our current moment.  
Harry Edwards recently recently wrote, “silence is evil’s greatest and most consistently dependable ally.” For all those engaged in these conversations, for those who have written, spoke about, and organized around racial injustice, silence is antithetical to our work, our ethos.  Yet, too often people speak past one another; too many people presume because of the everyday saturation of sports culture, the ubiquity of media coverage of the Colin Kaepernick, and the hypervisibility (and invisibility) of racial discourse, along with the belief that this is all about opinions and “two sides” that they are prepared for these important conversations.   
Too often, especially within the media and from those whose whiteness - their privilege - insulates, empowers, and protects, people speak without the requisite tools, without the requisite historic foundation, and without necessary information. This offers a toolbox of knowledge, links to resources, and information. The #Kaepernick syllabus furthers the efforts to disrupt the silence, to make connections, and to otherwise build on the work of Kaepernick, Edwards, members of the WNBA, Bomani Jones, Serena Williams, and so many others demanding that we speak and act.  While continuing the conversation is important, it must be done so with literacy and knowledge about American racism, the history of sports, the African American athlete, #BLM, protests, and so much more.  Discussions aren’t inherently transformative but with the requisite understanding, introspection about privilege and widely-held assumptions, and critical examination, we are better equipped as we walk toward justice and radical transformation #KapernickSyllabus #WeSitWithKaep

SALT LAKE CITY — Josh Romney said Thursday it's tough for him and his father, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to witness what may be ""permanent damage"" to the Republican Party from Donald Trump's candidacy. 
The concern, Josh Romney told members of the BYU Management Society gathered at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, is that the 2016 GOP nominee has hurt the party's image with minority voters because of his statements on race and religion. 
""His Hispanic and black outreach has been minimal at best and harmful in many ways,"" Romney said, noting the billionaire businessman's efforts to win a larger percentage of white voters than past GOP candidates is not a winning one. 
That's because, Romney said, his father ""would have won by a bigger landslide than Ronald Regan did against Jimmy Carter"" had the nation's demographics not changed since 1980 because he received a higher percentage of the white vote than Reagan. 
Republicans have to recognize the dramatic shift in the country's makeup, he said, and Trump's talking of deporting people in the country illegally, making Mexico pay to build a border wall and banning Muslims have been harmful. 
""So the concern is what Donald has done. Has it caused permanent damage to the Republican brand and the Republican Party among those minorities? Or is it something we can recover from? I'm not sure,"" Romney said. 
He called it ""astonishing"" that Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's pick for president, actually won their primary races and will be on the ballot in November. 
What needs to happen, Romney said, is for political parties ""to revamp next time, nominate people who stand for something, that will bring us together, unite us as a country, that will tackle hard issues. I believe that can happen."" 
This election year is going to be hard, especially on his father, said Romney, one of Mitt Romney's five sons. 
Mitt Romney slammed Trump as a phony and a fraud in a high-profile speech at the University of Utah just before the state's March GOP presidential preference caucus vote, likely helping Trump finish a distant third. 
The two-time presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor has said he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and has said he's considering the Libertarian Party ticket headed by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. 
On Wednesday, Romney tweeted for the first time in two months, telling Twitter followers he hopes voters get to see Johnson and his running mate, another former Massachusetts governor, William Weld, participate in this fall's debates. 
That's fueled speculation about a possible Romney endorsement, as has a recent meeting between a top Romney adviser in 2012 and a new entry into the presidential race, Evan McMullin, a Utah native and former CIA officer. 
Josh Romney said his father would ""love to be there in the fight. He was really hoping to see a young star rise out of the Republican darkness"" after toying briefly with a third White House bid. 
""It's tough and it's frustrating. We still talk about it a lot. He cares a lot about this country and about the party,"" Josh Romney said. ""It's tough to see what the party is going through."" 
Josh Romney called himself a believer in the Republican Party of Lincoln and Reagan, ""not Donald Trump,"" and said he hopes the GOP ""can remake our brand a little bit next go-round and be more inclusive and more optimistic."" 
Josh Romney, the president of a Utah-based real estate investment firm, has said he is considering a run for governor in 2020, but Thursday told a reporter he hasn't ""made a decision on anything, but I'm considering a lot of options."" Email:

Channel 3 News at 6 - WCIA-TV,9/9/2016 2:24,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

dyulapisa,9/9/2016 2:28,"Josh Romney warns of possible 'permanent damage' to GOP by Donald Trump
SALT LAKE CITY — Josh Romney said Thursday it’s tough for him and his father, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to witness what may be “permanent damage” to the Republican Party from Donald Trump’s candidacy.
The concern, Josh Romney told members of the BYU Management Society gathered at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, is that the 2016 GOP nominee has hurt the party’s image with minority voters because of his statements on race and religion.
“His Hispanic and black outreach has been minimal at best and harmful in many ways,” Romney said, noting the billionaire businessman’s efforts to win a larger percentage of white voters than past GOP candidates is not a winning one.
That’s because, Romney said, his father “would have won by a bigger landslide than Ronald Regan did against Jimmy Carter” had the nation’s demographics not changed since 1980 because he received a higher percentage of the white vote than Reagan.
Republicans have to recognize the dramatic shift in the country’s makeup, he said, and Trump’s talking of deporting people in the country illegally, making Mexico pay to build a border wall and banning Muslims have been harmful.
“So the concern is what Donald has done. Has it caused permanent damage to the Republican brand and the Republican Party among those minorities? Or is it something we can recover from? I’m not sure,” Romney said.
He called it “astonishing” that Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s pick for president, actually won their primary races and will be on the ballot in November.
What needs to happen, Romney said, is for political parties “to revamp next time, nominate people who stand for something, that will bring us together, unite us as a country, that will tackle hard issues. I believe that can happen.”
This election year is going to be hard, especially on his father, said Romney, one of Mitt Romney’s five sons.
Mitt Romney slammed Trump as a phony and a fraud in a high-profile speech at the University of Utah just before the state’s March GOP presidential preference caucus vote, likely helping Trump finish a distant third.
The two-time presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor has said he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and has said he’s considering the Libertarian Party ticket headed by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson.
On Wednesday, Romney tweeted for the first time in two months, telling Twitter followers he hopes voters get to see Johnson and his running mate, another former Massachusetts governor, William Weld, participate in this fall’s debates.
That’s fueled speculation about a possible Romney endorsement, as has a recent meeting between a top Romney adviser in 2012 and a new entry into the presidential race, Evan McMullin, a Utah native and former CIA officer.
Josh Romney said his father would “love to be there in the fight. He was really hoping to see a young star rise out of the Republican darkness” after toying briefly with a third White House bid.
“It’s tough and it’s frustrating. We still talk about it a lot. He cares a lot about this country and about the party,” Josh Romney said. “It’s tough to see what the party is going through.”
Josh Romney called himself a believer in the Republican Party of Lincoln and Reagan, “not Donald Trump,” and said he hopes the GOP “can remake our brand a little bit next go-round and be more inclusive and more optimistic.”
Josh Romney, the president of a Utah-based real estate investment firm, has said he is considering a run for governor in 2020, but Thursday told a reporter he hasn’t “made a decision on anything, but I’m considering a lot of options.”

WICC600,9/9/2016 2:30,"Is this 1,700-year-old tablet the world's oldest obituary?
(CNN) A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians at the time. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
The reference to the woman's faith is what makes this translation significant, Blumell said.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Here are five Tigers who could make an impact in Saturday’s game
With week one’s heartbreaking loss to BYU behind them, the Arizona Wildcats turn their attention to their first home game this Saturday. The opponent? The Grambling State Tigers.
The Tigers ripped off a 72-12 victory over the Virginia University of Lynchburg Dragons last week. They have a lot of speed on offense and do have big play capability. We should expect to see some zone-read offense from them as well. For some additional information on the matchup this week, Ronnie Stoffle wrote a first look .
Now let’s take a look at some potential impact players for Grambling:
Trevon Cherry, QB (No. 15) Cherry is one of the quarterbacks Arizona might see on Saturday and is the ""pocket passer"", so to speak. He is a sophomore, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have talent. He has a pretty decent arm with accuracy and might test the secondary early on. Last week he went 11-for-15 for 140 yards and two touchdowns.
Devante Kincade, QB (No. 1) Kincade is another quarterback Arizona should expect to see. He is an Ole Miss transfer, and a pretty talented dual-threat QB. There’s not much to speak of in terms of his accuracy, but he’s definitely a playmaker with his legs, especially on zone-read plays. If the Wildcat defense can get pressure on him and contain him, they might be able to force some errant throws. Last week, Kincade went 10-for-18 for 107 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. Running the ball, he had 139 yards on four carries and two touchdowns.
Chad Williams, WR (No. 10) Williams was the Tigers’ leading receiver in 2015, tallying 62 catches for 1,012 and 10 touchdowns. He is a big target, measuring 6-foot-2 and 193 pounds. He did not record any stats last week and I would kind of be surprised if he plays this week. On Sunday September 4, Williams and two other males were arrested for marijuana and possession of firearms on LSU’s campus . I haven’t seen any update on his punishment but I don’t exactly see him getting playing time this weekend. It isn’t fully out of the question though.
Martez Carter, RB (No. 4) Carter received second team All-SWAC honors as a sophomore last year after putting up some nice stats. He had 111 carries for 876 yards and nine rushing touchdowns. Carter also had 12 catches for 134 yards and four receiving touchdowns. This is impressive production given his size, which is 5-foot-8, 175 pounds. Last week, he had three carries for 78 yards and no touchdowns, plus a four-yard reception. I expect him to get more carries against the Wildcats.
Guy Stallworth, DB (No. 29) Stallworth, a senior, earned first team All-SWAC honors as a junior and is an anchor for Grambling’s secondary. At 6-foot-3, 215 pounds, he is a DB who has great length and size. I expect him to potentially make some plays against Arizona’s smaller receivers and possibly be flying all over the field. Last year he had 56 tackles, 4.0 TFL, 1.0 sacks, and two interceptions.

LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION, SHALL WE? 
COMPLETELY TESTED!!!
 ~ON 8/2/2016 (CLEAN AND CLEAR). So, have you ever got yourself tested at all???
The only one girl with “The best magic” of All…
‘The one & only cleanest , healthiest than yo’momma, yo’ wife , yo’ gf and you, combined….”
I GOT TESTED (BLOOD & URINE) & SWAB FOR MOUTH, ASS, WITH ALL COMPLETE ADVANCE LAB TEST, FOR ALL STDs/ HIV, Hep C etc (CLEAN AND CLEAR).
AND I’M ON PrEP ~ ( Meaning: Stds free and hiv free and no hepatitis A, B & C. And you can only be on PrEP if you have been completely tested, STDs FREE, NO health issues whatsoever (esp. liver, kidney & bones) and PrEP can only be prescribed by your doctor. If you’re HIV positive, you can’t be on PrEP (too little too late, the ship has sailed- And Oh Danny boy starts to play Uh Oh..). 
AND GET VACCINATED FOR:
1.PNEUMOCOCCAL 23-VALENT,
2.HPV (get the gardasil9 - New HPV Vaccine)
3.TDAP,
4.MENINGOCOCCAL
5. PLUS, IMMUNE OF HEPATITIS A/B TOO..
6. GOT MY COLONOSCOPY & COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS ETC..
DO YOU KNOW? VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. WELL, NOW YO DO…
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT ??
“THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE , THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD TO BANG, FIRST OF ALL, ON PrEP AND EARLY VACCINATIONS, AT LEAST  FOR EARLY HPV & HEPATITIS  (All 3 doses). There’s a newest HPV vaccine, gardasil9.
Three types of pathogens of concern, are Hepatitis , Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is much more contagious than HIV.  While HPV is the easiest and most common one, transmitted among people who are late to get the vaccines or never have the vaccines.There’s no cure for HPV & Condom do not protect you against Hepatitis & HPV at all, but Only early vaccinations do. Most of the guys, girls, gays, ts and bi, (you see or have been with), have either one or both or three of those pathogens. If they never get their early vaccinations or they’re late or never get tested for HIV (and/or NOT on PrEP). A Lot of people don’t even know what they have or not aware of them.
NOTE:
AND THOSE POPULAR GIRLS, GUYS, GAYS, PORNSTARS, HAVE HANKY-PANKY MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE. AS A RESULTS, THE MORE VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS THAT THEY HAVE. SIMPLE MATH, JUST PICTURE EACH GUY CHIPS IN WITH THEIR OWN STRAIN OF VIRUSES (HPV, HEP, OR POSSIBLY “HIV” TOO). SO, COUNT HOW MANY GUYS? 1? 10? 100?,  LET’S TAKE HPV FOR INSTANCE. DO YOU KNOW 14 MILLIONS NEW PEOPLE GET INFECTED BY HPV IN THE U.S EVERY YEAR (PER CDC). (THEY COULD BE YOUR TRICKS, HOOK UP FRIENDS, GIRLS/BOYS, GAYS, ESCORTS, SOMEONE’S HUSBAND/ WIFE) ETC. (VICIOUS CYCLE - KEEP ON MULTIPLYING…) 👀🙃
AND OF COURSE, “IF”~ IF THEY NEVER HAVE EARLY VACCINATIONS & IF THEY ARE NOT ON PREP. OR THEY NEVER HAVE VACCINATIONS AT ALL OR “LATE”. SOME MONSTERS ALREADY GOT IN THERE MMMM THAT’S RIGHT, SUGAH TITS. A DAY LATE & A DOLLAR SHORT… BUT IF YOU GOT VACCINATED  (HPV, HEPATITIS ETC) SINCE YOU’RE 13 - 15 LIKE ME, YOU’RE GOOD. WELL, YOU’RE JUST MMM SLUTTY. THE BIGGEST SLUT OF ALL, AREN’T YOU? YES YOU ARE..😄
AND AGAIN, ANYONE CAN SAY THEY HAD OR HAVE/ARE, BUT NO PROOF A.K.A “BLOWING SMOKE”. DON’T GET FOOLED BY THAT CRAP. IT’S A TREND MANY GIRLS OR GUYS USE NOWADAYS. (FOR EXAMPLE. DID YOU SEE THE BOTTLES OF PREP (TRUVADA) THEY HAVE TAKEN PRESCRIBED ON THEIR NAMES? (WELL, WELL, WELL LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN, A PINOCCHIOOO…) 😉
IF YOU’RE ON PrEP, THAT’S VERY GOOD.  BUT IF YOU DON’T GET VACCINATED FOR HPV & HEPATITIS. YOUR PROTECTION IS NOT COMPLETE. HPV & HEPATITIS ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEM (teenagers, girls, boys, men, women, gay, bi, straight -everyone really without early vaccinations) - (The main cause of CERVICAL CANCER, ANAL CANCER, COCK, BALLS, MOUTH, THROAT CANCER, LIVER CYST, LIVER CIRRHOSIS, LIVER CANCER ETC). MANY HAVE HPV & HEPATITIS AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM, AND AGAIN HIV TOO.
PLUS MEN CAN BE CARRIERS OF THESE HPV VIRUSES (OF ANY TYPES). As CDC states, “Many men who get HPV(of any types) might not develop symptoms and the infection for a while (It’s like a ticking bomb), and become “the carriers”, spreading around everywhere (their spouse, partners, hook-ups/tricks, girls, boys, gays, escorts, massage parlors etc). However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, colons, Vagina, vulva, cervix,  mouth, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)”.
“CONDOMS DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM HPV VIRUSES & HEPATITIS A,B & C, ONLY EARLY VACCINES DO”. IF YOU’RE LATE TO GET THE HPV VACCINES, YOU’RE LATE TO THOSE HPV VIRUSES, YOU HAVE GOT. ONCE YOU GET THE HPV (OF ANY TYPES), IT STAYS, IN YOU FOREVER. AND CONDOMS CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU FROM HIV UP TO 70%, WITH 30% RISK. NEW MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH TO PEVENT HIV IS  “PrEP”.
According to CDC, Vaccine-preventable diseases cause long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death.Did You Know that?
Each year In the United States:1. Each year, an average of 226,000 people are hospitalized due to influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die of influenza and its complications, the majority are among adults.2. There were approximately 32,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2012. Of those cases, there were about 3,300 deaths.3. 800,000 to 1.4 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, with complications such as liver cancer.4. In the U.S., HPV causes about 17,000 cancers in women, and about 9,000 cancers in men each year. About 10,000 die each year from HPV related cancers.
5. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 50 men will receive a diagnosis of HIV infection at some point in their lifetimes. Over the course of their lifetimes, 1 in 15 black men/women will be diagnosed with HIV infection, as will 1 in 18 Hispanic/ Latino men/women, 1 in 25 white men/women, 1 in 30  Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander men/women,  1 in 50 American Indian/Alaska Native men/women. 
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT?? 
Did you ever kiss, lick, touch, suck, drink, sex (vagina, ass, oral), with other girl, guy, ts, escorts or anyone who do not get their early vaccinations and/or on PrEP ? If you did or do, you just have to. 
Only complete advance lab test (blood, urine & swabs) will let you know for sure. It’s better to know your body & health than Not. Only a fool ignores his own body or health. No matter whom you’re with (gf, bf, hook-ups, someone’s gf, bf, wife, husband, tricks,1 nightstand, college friends, gay, bi, straight, escorts, porn stars, massage parlors etc), in any intimate event involve with:
 1.Skin touching skin ~HPV (hands, lips, genitals, massages etc), and 
2.Body fluids ~Hep A,B & C (saliva, pre-cum, cum etc), or 
3. Sex, oral or penetration ~ HIV, HPV & Hep ( oral, rim, penetrations, cock, vagina, handjob etc).
AND TO GO ON WITH THE STORY, MMM COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BECOOOOS THEY CAN PREVENT CANCERS. ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

Guy Stallworth, DB (No. 29)
Stallworth, a senior, earned first team All-SWAC honors as a junior and is an anchor for Grambling’s secondary. At 6-foot-3, 215 pounds, he is a DB who has great length and size. I expect him to potentially make some plays against Arizona’s smaller receivers and possibly be flying all over the field. Last year he had 56 tackles, 4.0 TFL, 1.0 sacks, and two interceptions.

Los Angeles Lakers 2016-17 Season Preview 
By 
Comments Please enable Javascript to watch this video 
Here’s to new beginnings as the Los Angeles Lakers embark on their seasonal voyage without the services of one Kobe Bean Bryant for the first time in 20 years. While no one within the organization was looking to kick dirt on his basketball grave, it is understandable if there is at least a slight amount of collective relief among the players as they head into a season with a significantly lower amount of expectations than this franchise is accustomed to. Any 17-win team coming off back-to-back-to-back “worst season ever” showings should be afforded such a luxury no matter what name is on the front of the jersey. 
Diehard fans may still struggle to maintain perspective at times, but the freedom that should come from simply being free of the scrutiny that was a result of the extended farewell tour should be liberating for all parties. Newly hired head coach Luke Walton made it clear he intends to judge this team by the progress it shows rather than wins and losses. That’s because while he is obviously new to his official role, he also realizes the pressure that will already be on a team headlined by a second-year point guard and rookie scoring prospect. On top of that, Los Angeles will feverishly be looking for someone to ascend from the pack as the team’s new leader and wear the de facto “face of the franchise” tag. 
The veteran additions of forward Luol Deng and center Timofey Mozgov should help with some of the transitioning, but there is obviously a ton of work to do in terms of reestablishing the team’s identity. Walton knows those things have to happen somewhat organically and wants to not only permit the process to take place, but also be afforded the same patience as he adjusts to life at the helm of a talented but still unproven team. FIVE GUYS THINK 
The dream of Russell Westbrook may have died, but with Brandon Ingram joining a core of youngsters that includes D’Angelo Russell, Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson, the Lakers have reason to be optimistic about their future. 
Timofey Mozgov became the poster child of the questionable contract, but he will absolutely fill a need for the Lakers this season. Though well past their primes, Luol Deng and Jose Calderon are each professionals who have been around the block in the NBA, and both know what it takes to be successful in the league. 
The first season of the post-Kobe Bryant era will have one less distraction and could possibly result in more wins after just 17 last season. With Luke Walton presumably installing a free-flowing system that will help keep the young guns in Los Angeles loose and engaged, we will likely see some of the talent accumulated pay off this season. Depending on how steep the learning curve is, the Lakers may surprise a few this season and show some fight. The Warriors and Clippers are still far outside their reach, but they should be competitive for the third seed in the division. I’d still be inclined to put the Kings above them since they have the best player, but even that is no guarantee. 
4th Place – Pacific Division 
– Moke Hamilton 
The Los Angeles Lakers enter the upcoming season without Kobe Bryant for the first time in roughly two decades. This really is the beginning of a new era for the proud franchise and its fans. Fortunately, the team features a core of young talent, including D’Angelo Russell, Julius Randle, Larry Nance Jr., Jordan Clarkson and Brandon Ingram. This strong nucleus will be led by rookie head coach Luke Walton, who will need to do a better job communicating with and developing the young guys than his predecessor Byron Scott did. The team also added veteran free agents Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov, plus made a deal for Jose Calderon. Deng and Mozgov were given a lot of money over the next four years, so the Lakers will need real production on the court from these guys and not just leadership in the locker room. Despite overpaying for Deng and Mozgov, the Lakers finally have a path towards rebuilding their team and a bright young coach to lead the way. 
5th Place – Pacific Division 
– Jesse Blancarte 
Lakers fans are ready to see this team turn the corner, and with young talent just dripping from the roster it’s easy to see why they’re so excited. Brandon Ingram’s name often is whispered in the same sentence as Kevin Durant’s, D’Angelo Russell could be on the brink of something really interesting this season, and we know what kind of young talents the team has in Jordan Clarkson, Julius Randle and Larry Nance Jr. On the other hand, they also excitedly doled out the summer’s worst contract to Timofey Mozgov and brought Chinese star Yi Jianlian back into the NBA after his exile spanning the better part of the last four seasons. There’s some fascinating young talent, but outside of Jose Calderon, Luol Deng and Yi, the “youngster” theme on this roster is pretty overwhelming. That means no matter how badly the Lakers faithful want to believe things will turn around quickly, they probably won’t, but at least they can sleep at night knowing things are back on the right track. It’s just going to take some time for it all to marinate. 
5th Place – Pacific Division 
– Joel Brigham 
For the first time since the 1996-97 season, the Lakers will head into training camp without the presence of future Hall of Fame guard Kobe Bryant. Through a combination of injuries and Father Time, the franchise has been prepared to move on to the next chapter for quite some time now. The Lakers have plenty of young talent with Jordan Clarkson, D’Angelo Russell and Julius Randle, and this summer the club invested in veteran free agent talent to surround their youth movement. Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov will be expected to help the young Lakers grow up and mature into top flight professionals and rookie head coach Luke Walton promises to remove the security blanket and throw his youngsters into the fire early. The Lakers will begin life after Bryant on the right foot, but unfortunately it won’t translate into significantly more wins in the short term. 
5th place – Pacific Division 
– Lang Greene 
All eyes will be on Luke Walton as he makes his head coaching debut with the Lakers this season. Walton did a terrific job with the Warriors when called upon, but many people wonder if his success was simply due to the star-laden roster. This is Walton’s opportunity to show what he can do and silence his doubters. Talking to players this summer, it’s clear that Walton has already started to change the team’s culture and everyone seems excited to play his brand of basketball. This is an intriguing team – a mix of young talent and experienced veterans – but it’s hard to imagine the Lakers seriously competing for a playoff spot in the Western Conference this season. Instead, this year is about getting Walton comfortable, turning things over to him and developing the young core as they buy in to the new system. 
5th Place – Pacific Division TOP OF THE LIST 
Top Offensive Player: D’Angelo Russell 
It’s important to note this isn’t solely asking which player will lead the team in scoring, although Russell should certainly have the ball in his hands enough to also challenge for that honor. The Lakers not only need Russell to be a multi-faceted and efficient scorer, but they’ll also need their 20-year-old point guard to be the type of floor general and leader that can also create offensive scoring opportunities for his teammates (3.3 assists per game as a rookie in 28.2 minutes per contest) while fostering a positive chemistry on the court and in the locker room. A tall task for any player, but especially for one as relatively inexperienced as Russell. Regardless, that’s the role these Lakers will need him to fill as they lay the new foundation. 
Top Defensive Player: Luol Deng 
Serious thought went into placing Ingram in this position given his potential to actually make a serious impact on that side of the ball as well, but he’ll undoubtedly face his fair share of growing pains as he continues to add strength and size to his frame. Deng may be new to the Los Angeles Mix, but the 31-year-old remains an above-average defender that can be utilized at several positions depending upon the matchup. Oft-injured during the middle section of career, the Lakers will also need him to display the type of durability that allowed him to play 72 or more games in each of the last two seasons for Miami. 
Top Playmaker: D’Angelo Russell 
Like we mentioned, the Lakers need Russell to be special. No other way to put it. The “ice in my veins” moments are great and will always be a part of the Sports Center package, but this team needs more steak than sizzle moving forward. Russell (13.2 PPG, 3.4 RPG, 3.3 APG as a rookie) is a better athlete than initially given credit and appears to be in better shape than he was at this point heading into his rookie campaign. Russell was a bit turnover prone at times as a rookie and saw his playing time and role fluctuate as a result, but the team has to hope the added conditioning and perhaps a slightly longer rope from the new staff could result in an increase in his overall productivity this season. 
Top Clutch Player: Brandon Ingram 
Although unfair to expect a rookie player to “place the team on his back” with any regularity, one of the main reasons the Lakers drafted Ingram was because of his impressive offensive skill-set for a man of his size. Listed at 6’9 and likely right around 200-205 pounds by the time training camp starts later this month, Ingram can shoot over the top of most defenders as well as put the ball down and create off the dribble. Once he possesses the necessary strength to physically compete against the tougher or heavier opponents, this young man is going to be a matchup nightmare – throughout the flow of the game, but obviously in “clutch” moments as well. This team may not have all that many opportunities for moments of that nature this season, but Ingram could be one of the guys they look to go to from an early point in the year. 
The Unheralded Player: Larry Nance Jr. 
As beloved and appreciated as Nance Jr. is by the fan base on social media, it still feels like a good portion of folks not covering the team and outside of the market doesn’t realize how effective Nance Jr. could ultimately be under Walton. He’s much more than simply a high-flying act, as the 23-year-old former Wyoming Cowboy continues expanding his shooting range and has better touch around the basket than you might think. Nance Jr.’s greatest contribution could actually end up being on the defensive end and on the backboards, especially if he is able to earn additional playing time (20.2 MPG as a rookie in ‘15-16). He’s a high-energy guy that can not only be a disruptor near the basket and in the passing lanes, but also someone that will change ends with the quickest of big men and finish over the top of plenty as well. 
Best New Addition: Brandon Ingram 
We certainly don’t mean to be repetitive, and while cases could be made for Deng’s eventual impact and even how Mozgov could make a difference as a rim protector and in mentoring other young bigs like second-round pick Ivica Zubac (purple and gold fingers crossed, probably), the reality is Ingram is the best player they added this summer. They took him with the second overall pick because of that fact. Ingram is oozing with talent and potential and isn’t done growing into his frame. 
– Jabari Davis WHO WE LIKE 
1. Luke Walton 
Walton returns to the organization after actually being traded away as a player at the 2012 deadline. Obviously, his path led him to even brighter things as a member of that successful Golden State Warriors’ staff over the past couple seasons, but few remember that his coaching career technically started back during the 2011 lockout when he took a position as an assistant under John Pastner and the same Memphis Tigers program that featured the exploits of a young Tarik Black. It’s almost shocking how quickly we’ve come full-circle, as Walton now has the opportunity to coach Black and this talented group of players for the organization he experienced so much success with as a player. 
Walton may no longer have the luxury of coaching a team that is immediately within the title mix, but he’s certainly not returning to bare cupboards in terms of talent to work with. With any young coach, especially those also faced with the challenge of guiding primarily young talent, fans and the organization must have patience with this process since there will undoubtedly be games that lead to questions in the early going. Beyond the need to end the trend of having a revolving door on the bench (Walton is the fourth head coach since Phil Jackson’s departure in 2011), he’s being asked to oversee a total shift in culture and direction. Players are noticeably excited about the opportunity to play in his new system, which is obviously a good thing, but now comes the time to actually adapt the approach and learn how Walton wants the game played. 
While much has been made about how well the offense will fit some of these players, the real challenge for Walton and staff will be in establishing a defensive identity with this roster. Not only will this staff have to continue teaching defensive principles, but they’ll also be tasked with the duty of convincing young players to take as much (if not more) pride in shutting someone down as they take in scoring on them. It may take time, but Walton is definitely equipped with a strong supporting cast of assistants to ease his transition into the head role. Former Laker player/coach Brian Shaw joins Jesse Mermuys and Mark Madsen, who was also retained by the organization. Casey Owens and Will Scott have also reportedly been promoted into assistant and coordinator roles as well. 
2. Julius Randle 
Perhaps the most interesting roster “battle” – or at least positional juxtaposition – could come from Randle and Nance Jr. While significantly chiseled and in much better shape than when he joined the organization, Randle is still a guy that wants to lower his shoulder and bull-rush you around the basket. Injury to his right hand aside, Randle has reportedly been working like a madman to improve all facets of his game this summer. Being able to keep the defense in a vulnerable position by continuing to add touch and range on his shot will likely be key to his ultimate success on the offensive end at this level, but he also needs to take a step forward as a defender. He was a walking double-double in ‘15-16 (34 total) and was at least willing to challenge at the rim some of the time, but fell prone to the same lapses, poor angles and improper footwork that tend to plague young defenders. He also tended to get himself into early foul trouble due to those undisciplined tactics and poor positioning, especially early in the year. 
Playing alongside more able-bodied defenders could and probably should help, but Randle will also need to improve his attention to detail and at least provide a consistent effort on that end if he wants to keep Nance Jr., Deng and others from potentially taking some of his playing time. It wasn’t exactly clear why the last coaching staff didn’t look to utilize more Russell-to-Randle pick-and-roll action – if for no reason other than to simply make scoring a bit easier for him – but we should probably expect to see more of it moving forward. Being able to effectively score around the bucket with his right hand and spread the defense out with the jumpshot are each vital, but sometimes giving a young player that extra space or step with some good pick-and-roll action can also make the difference simply from a confidence and comfort standpoint. The concern could have been with Randle’s ability to change directions once he gets his momentum going, but the 21-year-old did show improvement with his awareness and body control throughout the year. 
If you’re the Lakers, you might secretly love the idea of Nance Jr. functioning as a driving force behind Randle. As someone who has actually shown a fair amount of poise and maturity at an early age, Randle seems to possess a singular focus on simply being the best player he can be, and that will permit him to embrace the challenge in a manner that should be positive for both parties. The two of them could wind up pushing one another to the next level as players, and that certainly wouldn’t be a bad thing. 
3. Jordan Clarkson 
Due to the traffic sensational headlines can garner during the free agency period, Clarkson’s four year, $50 million deal was somewhat swept under the rug this summer, but it has the potential to become an absolutely phenomenal value contract for this team. Clarkson (15.5 PPG, 4.0 RPG, 2.3 APG in ’15-16) may not have had the chance to join his teammates on Team USA’s Select squad, but that doesn’t mean the young man hasn’t been putting in serious work in the gym and weight room this summer. Fans and opponents alike may be in for a surprise when they see the results of his dedicated workout regimen as the third-year guard really appears to be exhausting all efforts in order to continue improving. 
Clarkson was impressive as a rookie, particularly for a late second-round pick the Lakers actually purchased from the Wizards. He showed a solid level of improvement in year two, but if the 24-year-old can take yet another step as a playmaker and defender under the new regime then his deal would quickly become a steal. You don’t simply become a solid perimeter defender overnight, but Clarkson shows the physical tools of someone that is far more capable than he’s been in that department through two years. 
The freedom of the new system will also need to come with discipline. Clarkson can get a bit “out over his skis” when attacking at times, but he can be the type of interchangeable player you want when adopting a less constrained system. He was up to 34.7 percent from deep with about as disjointed an offensive system as you can imagine, and should see far more quality looks moving forward. If Clarkson can consistently knock down the deep ball while developing into a player that can at least adequately defend a couple positions (as is the ultimate hope), the Lakers will be in business. 
4. D’Angelo Russell 
If Russell is truly that transcendent type of player that some scouts and analysts believed he could be when coming into the league, then we should start to see significant strides in his game on both sides of the ball as early as this year. Last year may have appeared to be an unmitigated disaster considering his difficulties with professionalism, with maintaining his role and even position on the court at times, but Russell did show some real flashes of brilliance at certain moments. Not quite enough to offset some of the sophomoric behavior and antics for some, but he was able to do enough to make the organization at least appear to remain comfortable with the idea of Russell at the helm. 
Russell showed a clear ability to shoot the ball from distance at this level as the season wore on (38.8 percent or 57/147 from the start of February through the end of the season) and actually has a nice post-up and mid-post game you should probably anticipate seeing more and more of (especially against small or smallish opponents – yes, you, Isaiah Thomas and the like), but we have yet to see him consistently embrace being a playmaker as a Laker. After being intoxicated by comparisons to greats like Magic Johnson or Jason Kidd when it came to his passing, it seemed as though Russell was a bit more comfortable attacking NBA defenders as a scorer than he was with generating offense for others. 
To be clear, the 2015-16 Lakers didn’t have an awful lot of players capable of capitalizing on his creativity, but Russell also appeared to struggle against defenders that applied heavy pressure at times and he often adopted the “put your head down and go get a bucket” mentality many of today’s top scoring guards employ. With Walton likely to utilize a system similar to the one he was a part of in Golden State, there should be plenty of opportunities for Russell to display just how much ice his veins possess, but these Lakers need him to be dynamic and all-around offensive presence he was once advertised as being if they are to take the next step as a unit. 
5. Brandon Ingram 
We’d ask everyone to write, “I will not unfairly expect Ingram to immediately play like Kevin Durant” 100 times on the chalkboard if we thought it might help… but it won’t. Not with Ingram being built so similarly and being such a capable scorer at the same position. Especially not with guys like Durant himself making mention of it, as he did when the two faced one another during this summer’s Team USA training camp. While fans can’t be faulted for finding it difficult to curb their enthusiasm when it comes to this team, it will do all parties involved a service if a bit of patience is utilized with Ingram. 
He’ll undoubtedly have some nights that look incredible along the way, but they’ll probably be balanced with some rough ones against certain teams, especially in the early portion of the season as he adjusts to the pace and physicality. As a swingman, Ingram is not only going to have to figure out how to consistently score against top defenders and schemes expressly designed with limiting his comfort in mind, but he’ll also be charged with the responsibility of at least slowing down some of the league’s most dynamic scorers on the other end. 
Much like the reality that Russell was faced with as a rookie, Ingram will likely see a steady diet of Kevin Durant, Paul George, Kawhi Leonard, Andrew Wiggins, Gordon Hayward and probably even Rodney Hood all within the first 30 days of the regular season. Good luck with that. 
“Don’t get too high on the highs or too low on the lows” may be one of the more commonly used clichés in sports when dealing with a young team or player, but it will need to be the approach taken with Ingram and most of these players. As long as they continue to show progress along the way, that’s all that can be fairly asked. If what we’ve seen from Ingram while a member at the University of Duke and during the Last Vegas Summer League are any indication of what is to come, then we have a feeling fans will be more than willing to wait for his total development. 
6. Luol Deng 
While Deng’s contract partially swept up in the general disappointment and outcry over the Lakers failing to bring in some of the summer’s top names, he is actually a really good addition to this team. He may be 31 and have some miles on his body, but as mentioned, he remains a relatively versatile defender that can be depended upon to knock down the deep ball at a respectable level (34.4 percent in ‘15-16, 35.5 in ‘14-15). Whether he’s used primarily at the small forward or Walton elects to move him around according to the lineup and opponent, Deng’s value won’t be limited to the box score. 
He is the perfect guy for a locker room in need of guidance and professionalism. Last year in Miami really exemplified how Deng has somewhat seamlessly transitioned from being a primary focus and one of the main options of the offense – as he was throughout his time in Chicago – to a jack-of-all-trades member of the supporting cast. Quite honestly, it could have made a bit more sense for a player of Deng’s capability to join a roster that is closer to being an immediate playoff team. 
However, Deng makes sense for L.A. While developing young talent, you need a glue guy like Deng to contribute and hold things together during the difficult periods that will come over the course of an 82-game schedule. 
Similar to what guys like Joe Johnson (Utah Jazz) or even Al Jefferson (Indiana Pacers) did in accepting similar supporting roles, the fact that Deng decided to join this team at this time should absolutely be taken as a positive. Sure, money and the length of his deal (four years, $72 million) are factors, but Deng still has plenty to offer and could play a pivotal role in helping with the development of several others on the roster. 
– Jabari Davis SALARY CAP 101 
The Lakers used cap space to acquire players like Jordan Clarkson, Luol Deng, Timofey Mozgov, Jose Calderon, Ivica Zubac and Yi Jianlian. Now over the cap, the Lakers still have their $2.9 million Room Exception – although their roster is full with 15 guaranteed players. The Lakers are looking to get out of Nick Young’s salary ($11.1 million over two years), which could open a roster spot for Zach Auguste, Travis Wear or Julian Jacobs. 
Yi’s contract is unique in that it’s minimally guaranteed, ramping up by games played (20, 40 and 59), making Yi a potential trade piece starting Dec. 15. Looking ahead to next summer, the Lakers project to have at least $26.6 million in cap space, and more if they can get out of Young’s contract. That assumes the Lakers do not finish with a top-three pick in the 2017 lottery, instead sending their pick to the Philadelphia 76ers to close out the Steve Nash trade. The Lakers also have three easy decisions to make before November – the rookie-scale options for D’Angelo Russell, Julius Randle and Larry Nance are all no-brainers. 
– Eric Pincus STRENGTHS 
The added talent will definitely help, but the refreshing feeling around the team with the new direction already appears to be taking effect. Although down the road there could be some revised appreciation for the time they played for the previous staff, to a man, the players have each expressed great optimism about the current trajectory. Also, as mentioned, while a certain level of pressure will always come with playing under the bright lights of Staples Center and for this organization in general, at least this team won’t have anyone truly expecting them to compete for a playoff spot in the ever-challenging Western Conference for at least another year or so. The transition to a more free-flowing and uptempo style should not only be a far more entertaining product for the fans, but should lead to guys actually having more fun while out there on the court. 
– Jabari Davis WEAKNESSES 
Deng, Mozgov and perhaps Lou Williams aside, the majority of the core is still littered with early 20-somethings and guys that have less than three years of NBA experience. Randle was still in high school in 2013 and missed a year of action due to a leg fracture. As talented as he may be, Ingram was still playing high school basketball in Kinston, North Carolina in March of 2015. The NBA isn’t very forgiving on rookies and inexperienced players (see: last season), so there may be some games that look eerily similar to the more disappointing of nights over the past few seasons; but the main difference will be the team should actually be headed in a definitive direction these days. For fans, more disheartening than anything else over this stretch of futility was the fact that it at least appeared the front office may have been a bit lost over the past few years. 
The decisiveness with which they locked in on Walton coupled with all the spoils of their recent inefficacy -whether gathered intentionally or with a bit of luck along the way- at least present the appearance of a stable and clear-cut plan. Their lowest point also happened to coincide with the league shifting both from a financial/structural and on-court standpoint. Laker fans may shake their heads in disapproval, but the truth of the matter is to have potentially turned it around in as quickly as four years on the heels of losing the organization’s long-time patriarch in Dr. Buss and having to figure out the eventual hierarchy, influence and control between two very different siblings in Jeanie and Jim Buss, all while watching an aging superstar transition away would be a bit of a miracle when all things are considered. 
– Jabari Davis THE BURNING QUESTION 
The biggest question for this team will be: how long does it take them to individually develop so they can collectively improve? If a couple of the young guys were to actually take the next step on both sides of the ball while the other young prospects at least showed a steady rate of improvement, then a win-total as high as the upper-20s (or perhaps even low 30s if everything were to break somewhat favorably) is attainable. That prognosis may be a bit gloomy for some and is almost certain to outright anger others, but that’s why we’ve preached “perspective” throughout the preview. If the Lakers were to somehow reach a win range of even 28-32 games it would take a remarkable 11-15 game improvement from one season to the next, which would be a great accomplishment for any rebuilding team. Walton set the tone by establishing progress as his determining marker and that has to be the mindset and approach for everyone within the organization moving forward. This steady, even incremental advancement may be new for some of the younger amongst the fan base, but, by and large, these are the steps most franchises have to take when building a winner. The Lakers may not quite be there yet, but it is nice to see them headed in that direction once again.

Prestigious College or Major: Which Pays off More?

University attrition rates: Why are so many students dropping out?
Liz Burke, news.com.au
September 9, 2016 7:48am
FIRST year university students are leaving their original chosen courses at a higher rate than ever.
New data shows about one in five commencing bachelor students left their original course in 2014, and about 15 per cent dropped out completely.
The figures also see the increase in the number of students not completing their chosen course climb to more than one million for the first time.
Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, are defending the figures. They point out that while overall attrition rates are up, when it comes to the percentage of students dropping out of university completely in their first year (the adjusted attrition rate), the average figure is similar to past years, sticking at around 15 per cent for the past decade.
But the number of students leaving their first year courses is increasing — whether they find another place for themselves in the higher education system or not.
At the university with the worst attrition rate, the University of Tasmania, 42.26 per cent of first year students left their course during the first year, with most of those — 38.13 per cent of all first year students — dropped out of university altogether.
The University of Melbourne had the lowest attrition rate at 7.5 per cent. Its adjusted rate — taking out students who had left their course but enrolled in another — was only 3.74 per cent.
Universities Australia Deputy Chief Executive Catriona Jackson told news.com.au the attrition rates were no indictment on tertiary education providers. Rather, it was a “major achievement” that university access had been expanded to more Australians while keeping the dropout rate relatively stable.
“Research suggests attrition rates are higher for mature age and part-time students — and if you think about it, they’re the ones who may often be juggling university study with jobs, children and caring for elderly parents,” she said.
“Students battling disadvantage — including those who are first in their family to attend university — are also more likely to have thoughts about leaving.”
The experiences of disadvantaged students highlighted the importance of student support programs run by universities, which help students to find the support and resources they need to complete their degree, Ms Jackson said.
“The biggest factors for students who consider leaving university are often related to issues beyond university,” she said.
“They cite pressures with their health or stress, juggling work/life balance, the need to do paid work, their overall workload and financial difficulties among the top reasons for doing so.”
Grattan Institute higher education expert Andrew Norton told The Australian the attrition rates were worrying.
“The question is: are universities actually informing students of the risks they are taking on, particularly studying online, and are they being responsible in taking on students who are at high risk of not completing?”
The new data comes as the Federal Government awaits a report detailing recommendations about how best to make things clearer for students and keep them better informed.
The Higher Education Standards Panel, which is currently reviewing submissions over university admissions, has acknowledged greater transparency for students is needed to reshape higher education.

fortwaynehomepage.net,9/9/2016 2:43,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 12:21PM
Updated 09/08 2016 12:21PM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION, SHALL WE? 
COMPLETELY TESTED!!!
 ~ON 8/2/2016 (CLEAN AND CLEAR). So, have you ever got yourself tested at all???
The only one girl with “The best magic” of All…
‘The one & only cleanest , healthiest than yo’momma, yo’ wife , yo’ gf and you, combined….”
I GOT TESTED (BLOOD & URINE) & SWAB FOR MOUTH, ASS, WITH ALL COMPLETE ADVANCE LAB TEST, FOR ALL STDs/ HIV, Hep C etc (CLEAN AND CLEAR).
AND I’M ON PrEP ~ ( Meaning: Stds free and hiv free and no hepatitis A, B & C. And you can only be on PrEP if you have been completely tested, STDs FREE, NO health issues whatsoever (esp. liver, kidney & bones) and PrEP can only be prescribed by your doctor. If you’re HIV positive, you can’t be on PrEP (too little too late, the ship has sailed- And Oh Danny boy starts to play Uh Oh..). 
AND GET VACCINATED FOR:
1.PNEUMOCOCCAL 23-VALENT,
2.HPV (get the gardasil9 - New HPV Vaccine)
3.TDAP,
4.MENINGOCOCCAL
5. PLUS, IMMUNE OF HEPATITIS A/B TOO..
6. GOT MY COLONOSCOPY & COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS ETC..
DO YOU KNOW? VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. WELL, NOW YO DO…
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT ??
“THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE , THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD TO BANG, FIRST OF ALL, ON PrEP AND EARLY VACCINATIONS, AT LEAST  FOR EARLY HPV & HEPATITIS  (All 3 doses). There’s a newest HPV vaccine, gardasil9.
Three types of pathogens of concern, are Hepatitis , Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is much more contagious than HIV.  While HPV is the easiest and most common one, transmitted among people who are late to get the vaccines or never have the vaccines.There’s no cure for HPV & Condom do not protect you against Hepatitis & HPV at all, but Only early vaccinations do. Most of the guys, girls, gays, ts and bi, (you see or have been with), have either one or both or three of those pathogens. If they never get their early vaccinations or they’re late or never get tested for HIV (and/or NOT on PrEP). A Lot of people don’t even know what they have or not aware of them.
AND THE MORE POPULAR A GIRL, THE MORE “ADMIRERS” THEY HAVE.  AS A RESULT OF LOTS OF “ADMIRERS”, THE MORE VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS THAT THEY HAVE. SIMPLE MATH. JUST PICTURE EACH GUY CHIPS IN WITH THEIR OWN STRAIN OF VIRUSES (HPV, HEP, OR POSSIBLY “HIV” TOO). SO, COUNT HOW MANY GUYS? 1? 10? 100?,  LET’S TAKE HPV FOR INSTANCE. DO YOU KNOW 14 MILLIONS NEW PEOPLE GET INFECTED BY HPV IN THE U.S EVERY YEAR (PER CDC). (THEY COULD BE YOUR TRICKS, HOOK UP FRIENDS, GIRLS/BOYS, GAYS, ESCORTS, SOMEONE’S HUSBAND/ WIFE) ETC. (VICIOUS CYCLE - KEEP ON MULTIPLYING…) 👀🙃
AND OF COURSE, “IF”~ IF THEY NEVER HAVE EARLY VACCINATIONS & IF THEY ARE NOT ON PREP. OR THEY NEVER HAVE VACCINATIONS AT ALL OR “LATE”. SOME MONSTERS ALREADY GOT IN THERE MMMM THAT’S RIGHT, SUGAH TITS. A DAY LATE & A DOLLAR SHORT… BUT IF YOU GOT VACCINATED  (HPV, HEPATITIS ETC) SINCE YOU’RE 13 - 15 LIKE ME, YOU’RE GOOD. WELL, YOU’RE JUST MMM SLUTTY. THE BIGGEST SLUT OF ALL, AREN’T YOU? YES YOU ARE..😄 AND AGAIN, ANYONE CAN SAY THEY HAD OR HAVE/ARE, BUT NO PROOF A.K.A “BLOWING SMOKE”. DON’T GET FOOLED BY THAT CRAP. IT’S A TREND MANY GIRLS OR GUYS USE NOWADAYS. (FOR EXAMPLE. DID YOU SEE THE BOTTLES OF PREP (TRUVADA) THEY HAVE TAKEN PRESCRIBED ON THEIR NAMES? (WELL, WELL, WELL LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN, A PINOCCHIOOO…) 😉
IF YOU’RE ON PrEP, THAT’S VERY GOOD.  BUT IF YOU DON’T GET VACCINATED FOR HPV & HEPATITIS. YOUR PROTECTION IS NOT COMPLETE. HPV & HEPATITIS ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEM (teenagers, girls, boys, men, women, gay, bi, straight -everyone really without early vaccinations) - (The main cause of CERVICAL CANCER, ANAL CANCER, COCK, BALLS, MOUTH, THROAT CANCER, LIVER CYST, LIVER CIRRHOSIS, LIVER CANCER ETC). MANY HAVE HPV & HEPATITIS AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM, AND AGAIN HIV TOO.
PLUS MEN CAN BE CARRIERS OF THESE HPV VIRUSES (OF ANY TYPES). As CDC states, “Many men who get HPV(of any types) might not develop symptoms and the infection for a while (It’s like a ticking bomb), and become “the carriers”, spreading around everywhere (their spouse, partners, hook-ups/tricks, girls, boys, gays, escorts, massage parlors etc). However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, colons, Vagina, vulva, cervix,  mouth, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)”.
“CONDOMS DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM HPV VIRUSES & HEPATITIS A,B & C, ONLY EARLY VACCINES DO”. IF YOU’RE LATE TO GET THE HPV VACCINES, YOU’RE LATE TO THOSE HPV VIRUSES, YOU HAVE GOT. ONCE YOU GET THE HPV (OF ANY TYPES), IT STAYS, IN YOU FOREVER. AND CONDOMS CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU FROM HIV UP TO 70%, WITH 30% RISK. NEW MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH TO PEVENT HIV IS  “PrEP”.
According to CDC, Vaccine-preventable diseases cause long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death.Did You Know that?
Each year In the United States:1. Each year, an average of 226,000 people are hospitalized due to influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die of influenza and its complications, the majority are among adults.2. There were approximately 32,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2012. Of those cases, there were about 3,300 deaths.3. 800,000 to 1.4 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, with complications such as liver cancer.4. In the U.S., HPV causes about 17,000 cancers in women, and about 9,000 cancers in men each year. About 10,000 die each year from HPV related cancers.
5. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 50 men will receive a diagnosis of HIV infection at some point in their lifetimes. Over the course of their lifetimes, 1 in 15 black men/women will be diagnosed with HIV infection, as will 1 in 18 Hispanic/ Latino men/women, 1 in 25 white men/women, 1 in 30  Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander men/women,  1 in 50 American Indian/Alaska Native men/women. 
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT?? 
Did you ever kiss, lick, touch, suck, drink, sex (vagina, ass, oral), with other girl, guy, ts, escorts or anyone who do not get their early vaccinations and/or on PrEP ? If you did or do, you just have to. 
Only complete advance lab test (blood, urine & swabs) will let you know for sure. It’s better to know your body & health than Not. Only a fool ignores his own body or health. No matter whom you’re with (gf, bf, hook-ups, someone’s gf, bf, wife, husband, tricks,1 nightstand, college friends, gay, bi, straight, escorts, porn stars, massage parlors etc), in any intimate event involve with:
 1.Skin touching skin ~HPV (hands, lips, genitals, massages etc), and 
2.Body fluids ~Hep A,B & C (saliva, pre-cum, cum etc), or 
3. Sex, oral or penetration ~ HIV, HPV & Hep ( oral, rim, penetrations, cock, vagina, handjob etc).
AND TO GO ON WITH THE STORY, MMM COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BECOOOOS THEY CAN PREVENT CANCERS. ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

93.9 The Beat,9/9/2016 2:51,"Is this 1,700-year-old tablet the world's oldest obituary?
(CNN) A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians at the time. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
The reference to the woman's faith is what makes this translation significant, Blumell said.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

The Iowa State student senate joins more than two dozen LGBT advocacy groups, which last month wrote a letter to Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby and the league's presidents. Those groups have criticized and accused BYU's honor code, which prohibits ""homosexual behavior.""
The student senate provided The Ames Tribune with a statement about its resolution.
""Student Government's goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed. The Senate finds that Brigham Young University's Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU's membership bid to the Big XII at this time.""
The Big 12 is meeting with officials from 11 expansion candidates in Dallas this week.

Brett Stevens,9/9/2016 3:02,"Apparently, 9/11 conspiracies are back on the menu, boys, and surely this cannot be a cynical attention grab by an organization in need of grant money:
The study is the work of Steven Jones, former full professor of physics at Brigham Young University, Robert Korol, a professor emeritus of civil engineering at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, Anthony Szamboti, a mechanical design engineer with over 25 years of structural design experience in the aerospace and communications industries, and Ted Walter, the director of strategy and development for Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth, a nonprofit organization that today represents more than 2,500 architects and engineers.
…They write: “The total collapse of WTC 7 at 5:20 pm on 9/11, is remarkable because it exemplified all the signature features of an implosion: The building dropped in absolute free fall for the first 2.25 seconds of its descent over a distance of 32 meters or eight stories. Its transition from stasis to free fall was sudden, occurring in approximately one-half second. It fell symmetrically straight down. Its steel frame was almost entirely dismembered and deposited mostly inside the building’s footprint, while most of its concrete was pulverized into tiny particles. Finally, the collapse was rapid, occurring in less than seven seconds. Given the nature of the collapse, any investigation adhering to the scientific method should have seriously considered the controlled demolition hypothesis, if not started with it. Instead, NIST (as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which conducted a preliminary study prior to the NIST investigation) began with the predetermined conclusion that the collapse was caused by fires.”
Given those qualifications, it is unlikely that these guys are wrong. But what if it is a GIGO situation?
When scientists reconstruct an event, they work from wreckage, and get much of their data — their initial assumptions — from blueprints and old news reports and official statistics, many of which are self-reported.
If we apply Occam’s Razor to the 9/11 event, we see that some buildings fall down after a terrorist attack. Barring everything else, what might a sensible initial position be?
We might use the same position we use any other time a building falls down unexpectedly: shoddy construction or bad math in the design.
Another factor is the quality of steel that is claimed to be used, versus what was actually in there. or any other building material.
It is hard to say what went down on September 11, 2001, but we may not need to look very far for an explanation. Corners were cut, union labor was used, and just like in the third world, our buildings fall down.

(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""

Iowa State student government against BYU’s potential addition to Big 12 September 8, 2016 0 
The student government at Iowa State University passed a resolution on Sept. 7 formally declaring they are against BYU’s potential addition to the Big 12 conference. 
The resolution was introduced by Abhijit Patwa and passed 21-6. The reasoning stems mainly from the Honor Code, with the student government deciding that “BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12.” 
This isn’t the first time BYU’s Honor Code has been under fire since Big 12 expansion began. LBGT groups have also lobbied the Big 12 to reject BYU, feeling the Honor Code is discriminatory in nature in regards to homosexuals. 
Student government president Cole Staudt opposed the resolution and released this statement on Twitter. In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0 
— ISU StuGov President (@ISUStuGovPres) September 8, 2016 
BYU was named to the Big 12’s shortlist of schools the conference is considering for expansion last week. 
The student government’s resolution will be sent to presidents of all Big 12 schools

KSL.com,9/9/2016 3:08,"PROVO — All had been pretty quiet on the Big 12 front as expansion candidates made their pitches for inclusion into the conference, including BYU.
But the student government of one of the conference’s founding schools is speaking out.
The Iowa State Student Senate passed a resolution Wednesday night arguing against BYU’s inclusion in the Big 12 because it 'believes that BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12 Conference.'
The language of the resolution is similar to a letter drafted by LGBT advocacy group Athlete Ally and other organizations last month in which it alleged BYU’s Honor Code explicitly discriminates against LGBTQ student-athletes. The ISU student government alleged similar discriminations in that BYU prohibits 'sexual relations between members of the same sex, and all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings,' according to the resolution posted on the student government’s Facebook page.
'Student government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed,' the senate said in a statement to the Ames (Iowa) Tribune . 'The senate finds that Brigham Young University’s honor code does not communicate nor reflect the values that the Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the senate of student government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.'
Related Story
Athlete Ally, a non-profit group of LGBTQ activists for sports league, and the National Center for Lesbian Rights released a letter Monday urging the Big 12 conference to not admit BYU as a member school because of what it believes to be discriminatory practices by the university and its sponsor, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
BYU spokeswoman Carri Jenkins responded to the Athlete Ally letter at the time in an official statement from the university.
'BYU welcomes as full members of the university community all whose conduct meets university standards,' the statement read. 'We are very clear and open about our honor code, which all students understand and commit to when they apply for admission. One’s state sexual orientation is not an issue.'
BYU athletic director Tom Holmoe also released a statement via Twitter at the time.
'LGBT players, coaches and fans are always welcome to the BYU campus,' he said. 'Everyone should be treated with respect, dignity and love.'
Not everyone in the school’s student government voted in favor of the resolution. Student government president Cole Staudt argued the Student Senate should not pass the memorandum against BYU.
'I have been speaking with other presidents of Big 12 institutions,' Staudt told the school newspaper Iowa State Daily . 'A number of them said that they don’t believe we should be taking a position at all.'
Staudt released a lengthy statement Thursday afternoon pertaining to the vote and BYU's potential inclusion in the Big 12.
'BYU’s policies against the LGBT community are contrary to the community we desire in the United States. However, if we are truly committed to making change in this country and creating an inclusive nation, we cannot do it by excluding others,"" he said.
'I believe that the most effective way to change what I see in BYU’s policies, is with love.'
In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0
- ISU StuGov President (@ISUStuGovPres) September 8, 2016
In all, 21 senators voted in favor of the resolution and six voted against it. The resolution will be sent to Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby and the conference’s expansion committee made up of the 10 university presidents.
The conference continues to meet with 11 expansion candidates ranging from BYU, Cincinnati and Houston to Central Florida, Connecticut and Tulane this week in Dallas.
The Cyclones were charter members of the Big 12 when it formed in 1994, supplanting the old Big Eight and Southwest conferences. The northernmost school in the Big 12, Iowa State has a 510-620-46 all-time record in football and a 3-9 record in postseason play.
Iowa State has never won a Big 12 championship, though the Cyclones were Big 12 North champions in 2004, when they finished 7-5 with a 27-24 loss to TCU in the Houston Bowl.
Iowa State opened the 2016 season with a 25-20 home loss to Northern Iowa. The Cyclones play at Iowa on Saturday.
The Cougars are 0-4 all-time against Iowa State in four meetings between 1968 and 1974.

LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION, SHALL WE? 
COMPLETELY TESTED!!!
 ~ON 8/2/2016 (CLEAN AND CLEAR). So, have you ever got yourself tested at all???
The only one girl with “The best magic” of All…
‘The one & only cleanest , healthiest than yo’momma, yo’ wife , yo’ gf and you, combined….”
I GOT TESTED (BLOOD & URINE) & SWAB FOR MOUTH, ASS, WITH ALL COMPLETE ADVANCE LAB TEST, FOR ALL STDs/ HIV, Hep C etc (CLEAN AND CLEAR).
AND I’M ON PrEP ~ ( Meaning: Stds free and hiv free and no hepatitis A, B & C. And you can only be on PrEP if you have been completely tested, STDs FREE, NO health issues whatsoever (esp. liver, kidney & bones) and PrEP can only be prescribed by your doctor. If you’re HIV positive, you can’t be on PrEP (too little too late, the ship has sailed- And Oh Danny boy starts to play Uh Oh..). 
AND GET VACCINATED FOR:
1.PNEUMOCOCCAL 23-VALENT,
2.HPV (get the gardasil9 - New HPV Vaccine)
3.TDAP,
4.MENINGOCOCCAL
5. PLUS, IMMUNE OF HEPATITIS A/B TOO..
6. GOT MY COLONOSCOPY & COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS ETC..
DO YOU KNOW? VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. WELL, NOW YO DO…
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT ??
“THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE , THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD TO BANG, FIRST OF ALL, ON PrEP AND EARLY VACCINATIONS, AT LEAST  FOR EARLY HPV & HEPATITIS  (All 3 doses). There’s a newest HPV vaccine, gardasil9.
Three types of pathogens of concern, are Hepatitis , Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is much more contagious than HIV.  While HPV is the easiest and most common one, transmitted among people who are late to get the vaccines or never have the vaccines.There’s no cure for HPV & Condom do not protect you against Hepatitis & HPV at all, but Only early vaccinations do. Most of the guys, girls, gays, ts and bi, (you see or have been with), have either one or both or three of those pathogens. If they never get their early vaccinations or they’re late or never get tested for HIV (and/or NOT on PrEP). A Lot of people don’t even know what they have or not aware of them.
AND THE MORE POPULAR A GIRL, THE MORE “ADMIRERS” THEY HAVE.  AS A RESULT OF LOTS OF “ADMIRERS” A.K.A “SEX”, THE MORE VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS THAT THEY HAVE. JUST PICTURE EACH GUY CHIPS IN WITH THEIR OWN STRAIN OF VIRUSES (HPV, HEP, OR POSSIBLY “HIV” TOO). SO, COUNT HOW MANY GUYS? 1? 10? 100?,  LET’S SAY “HPV”. DO YOU KNOW 14 MILLIONS NEW PEOPLE GET INFECTED BY HPV IN THE U.S EVERY YEAR (PER CDC). (AND THEY COULD BE YOUR TRICKS, HOOK UP FRIENDS, GIRLS/BOYS, GAYS, ESCORTS, SOMEONE’S HUSBAND/ WIFE ETC.)  (VICIOUS CYCLE - AND KEEP ON MULTIPLYING…) 👀🙃
AND OF COURSE, IF THEY NEVER HAVE EARLY VACCINATIONS OR IF THEY’RE LATE, OR WORSE IF THEY NEVER GOT VACCINATED AT ALL. THEY ALL BECOME “THE HOSTS” A.K.A “DEADLY CARRIERS”.  
BUT IF YOU GOT VACCINATED  (HPV, HEPATITIS ETC) SINCE YOU’RE 13 - 15 LIKE ME, YOU’RE GOOD. WELL, YOU’RE JUST MMM SLUTTY. THE BIGGEST SLUT OF ALL, AREN’T YOU? YES YOU ARE..😄 AND AGAIN, ANYONE CAN SAY THEY HAD OR HAVE/ARE, BUT NO PROOF A.K.A “BLOWING SMOKE”. DON’T GET FOOLED BY THAT CRAP. IT’S A TREND MANY GIRLS OR GUYS USE NOWADAYS. (FOR EXAMPLE. DID YOU SEE THE BOTTLES OF PREP (TRUVADA) THEY HAVE TAKEN PRESCRIBED ON THEIR NAMES? (WELL, WELL, WELL LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN, A PINOCCHIOOO…) 😉
IF YOU’RE ON PrEP, THAT’S VERY GOOD.  BUT IF YOU DON’T GET VACCINATED FOR HPV & HEPATITIS. YOUR PROTECTION IS NOT COMPLETE. HPV & HEPATITIS ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEM (teenagers, girls, boys, men, women, gay, bi, straight -everyone really without early vaccinations) - (The main cause of CERVICAL CANCER, ANAL CANCER, COCK, BALLS, MOUTH, THROAT CANCER, LIVER CYST, LIVER CIRRHOSIS, LIVER CANCER ETC). MANY HAVE HPV & HEPATITIS AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM, AND AGAIN HIV TOO.
PLUS MEN CAN BE CARRIERS OF THESE HPV VIRUSES (OF ANY TYPES). As CDC states, “Many men who get HPV(of any types) might not develop symptoms and the infection for a while (It’s like a ticking bomb), and become “the carriers”, spreading around everywhere (their spouse, partners, hook-ups/tricks, girls, boys, gays, escorts, massage parlors etc). However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, colons, Vagina, vulva, cervix,  mouth, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)”.
“CONDOMS DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM HPV VIRUSES & HEPATITIS A,B & C, ONLY EARLY VACCINES DO”. IF YOU’RE LATE TO GET THE HPV VACCINES, YOU’RE LATE TO THOSE HPV VIRUSES, YOU HAVE GOT. ONCE YOU GET THE HPV (OF ANY TYPES), IT STAYS, IN YOU FOREVER. AND CONDOMS CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU FROM HIV UP TO 70%, WITH 30% RISK. NEW MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH TO PEVENT HIV IS  “PrEP”.
According to CDC, Vaccine-preventable diseases cause long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death.Did You Know that?
Each year In the United States:1. Each year, an average of 226,000 people are hospitalized due to influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die of influenza and its complications, the majority are among adults.2. There were approximately 32,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2012. Of those cases, there were about 3,300 deaths.3. 800,000 to 1.4 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, with complications such as liver cancer.4. In the U.S., HPV causes about 17,000 cancers in women, and about 9,000 cancers in men each year. About 10,000 die each year from HPV related cancers.
5. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 50 men will receive a diagnosis of HIV infection at some point in their lifetimes. Over the course of their lifetimes, 1 in 15 black men/women will be diagnosed with HIV infection, as will 1 in 18 Hispanic/ Latino men/women, 1 in 25 white men/women, 1 in 30  Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander men/women,  1 in 50 American Indian/Alaska Native men/women. 
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT?? 
Did you ever kiss, lick, touch, suck, drink, sex (vagina, ass, oral), with other girl, guy, ts, escorts or anyone who do not get their early vaccinations and/or on PrEP ? If you did or do, you just have to. 
Only complete advance lab test (blood, urine & swabs) will let you know for sure. It’s better to know your body & health than Not. Only a fool ignores his own body or health. No matter whom you’re with (gf, bf, hook-ups, someone’s gf, bf, wife, husband, tricks,1 nightstand, college friends, gay, bi, straight, escorts, porn stars, massage parlors etc), in any intimate event involve with:
 1.Skin touching skin ~HPV (hands, lips, genitals, massages etc), and 
2.Body fluids ~Hep A,B & C (saliva, pre-cum, cum etc), or 
3. Sex, oral or penetration ~ HIV, HPV & Hep ( oral, rim, penetrations, cock, vagina, handjob etc).
AND TO GO ON WITH THE STORY, MMM COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BECOOOOS THEY CAN PREVENT CANCERS. ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

Scott G Winterton, Deseret News, File Josh Romney warns of possible 'permanent damage' to GOP by Donald Trump By Lisa Riley Roche  14pm 7  
SALT LAKE CITY — Josh Romney said Thursday it's tough for him and his father, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to witness what may be ""permanent damage"" to the Republican Party from Donald Trump's candidacy. 
The concern, Josh Romney told members of the BYU Management Society gathered at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, is that the 2016 GOP nominee has hurt the party's image with minority voters because of his statements on race and religion. 
""His Hispanic and black outreach has been minimal at best and harmful in many ways,"" Romney said, noting the billionaire businessman's efforts to win a larger percentage of white voters than past GOP candidates is not a winning one. 
That's because, Romney said, his father ""would have won by a bigger landslide than Ronald Regan did against Jimmy Carter"" had the nation's demographics not changed since 1980 because he received a higher percentage of the white vote than Reagan. 
Republicans have to recognize the dramatic shift in the country's makeup, he said, and Trump's talking of deporting people in the country illegally, making Mexico pay to build a border wall and banning Muslims have been harmful. 
""So the concern is what Donald has done. Has it caused permanent damage to the Republican brand and the Republican Party among those minorities? Or is it something we can recover from? I'm not sure,"" Romney said. 
He called it ""astonishing"" that Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's pick for president, actually won their primary races and will be on the ballot in November. 
What needs to happen, Romney said, is for political parties ""to revamp next time, nominate people who stand for something, that will bring us together, unite us as a country, that will tackle hard issues. I believe that can happen."" Related AP FACT CHECK: Trump on immigration Wednesday was supposed to be the day Donald Trump clarified his immigration stance. But in a key speech on that subject, he misstated facts about immigration policy, life for those in the country illegally and their impact on the U.S. economy. 
This election year is going to be hard, especially on his father, said Romney, one of Mitt Romney's five sons. 
Mitt Romney slammed Trump as a phony and a fraud in a high-profile speech at the University of Utah just before the state's March GOP presidential preference caucus vote, likely helping Trump finish a distant third. 
The two-time presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor has said he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and has said he's considering the Libertarian Party ticket headed by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. 
On Wednesday, Romney tweeted for the first time in two months, telling Twitter followers he hopes voters get to see Johnson and his running mate, another former Massachusetts governor, William Weld, participate in this fall's debates. I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall. — Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 7, 2016 
That's fueled speculation about a possible Romney endorsement, as has a recent meeting between a top Romney adviser in 2012 and a new entry into the presidential race, Evan McMullin, a Utah native and former CIA officer. 
Josh Romney said his father would ""love to be there in the fight. He was really hoping to see a young star rise out of the Republican darkness"" after toying briefly with a third White House bid. 
""It's tough and it's frustrating. We still talk about it a lot. He cares a lot about this country and about the party,"" Josh Romney said. ""It's tough to see what the party is going through."" 
Josh Romney called himself a believer in the Republican Party of Lincoln and Reagan, ""not Donald Trump,"" and said he hopes the GOP ""can remake our brand a little bit next go-round and be more inclusive and more optimistic."" 
Josh Romney, the president of a Utah-based real estate investment firm, has said he is considering a run for governor in 2020, but Thursday told a reporter he hasn't ""made a decision on anything, but I'm considering a lot of options."" Related Stories

MTodd,9/9/2016 3:16,"Great post! How often we argue past each other.
Elder Wickman made it clear that one of the key reasons Church leaders are worried about maintaining religious freedom is to maintain the Church's tax exempt status.
http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/promoting-religious-freedom-secular-age-fundamental-principles-practical-priorities-fairness-for-all
And I think they have reason to fear. I doubt the courts or government would ever try to force solemnization of same-sex unions in the temple. That's just chum for mobilizing the conservative right-wingers into action. No, the real concern is a world that recognizes BYU's honor code as discriminatory therefore no more tax exempt status for the university. Or the Church is seen as a discriminatory institution, therefore no more tax breaks on it's non-profit holdings. This is a legitimate fear. And after the November exclusionary policy, I'm not sure I'd mind that financial pressure being exerted on the Church.

LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION, SHALL WE? 
COMPLETELY TESTED!!!
 ~ON 8/2/2016 (CLEAN AND CLEAR). So, have you ever got yourself tested at all???
The only one girl with “The best magic” of All…
‘The one & only cleanest , healthiest than yo’momma, yo’ wife , yo’ gf and you, combined….”
I GOT TESTED (BLOOD & URINE) & SWAB FOR MOUTH, ASS, WITH ALL COMPLETE ADVANCE LAB TEST, FOR ALL STDs/ HIV, Hep C etc (CLEAN AND CLEAR).
AND I’M ON PrEP ~ ( Meaning: Stds free and hiv free and no hepatitis A, B & C. And you can only be on PrEP if you have been completely tested, STDs FREE, NO health issues whatsoever (esp. liver, kidney & bones) and PrEP can only be prescribed by your doctor. If you’re HIV positive, you can’t be on PrEP (too little too late, the ship has sailed- And Oh Danny boy starts to play Uh Oh..). 
AND GET VACCINATED FOR:
1.PNEUMOCOCCAL 23-VALENT,
2.HPV (get the gardasil9 - New HPV Vaccine)
3.TDAP,
4.MENINGOCOCCAL
5. PLUS, IMMUNE OF HEPATITIS A/B TOO..
6. GOT MY COLONOSCOPY & COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS ETC..
DO YOU KNOW? VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. WELL, NOW YO DO…
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT ??
“THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE , THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD TO BANG, FIRST OF ALL, ON PrEP AND EARLY VACCINATIONS, AT LEAST  FOR EARLY HPV & HEPATITIS  (All 3 doses). There’s a newest HPV vaccine, gardasil9.
Three types of pathogens of concern, are Hepatitis , Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is much more contagious than HIV.  While HPV is the easiest and most common one, transmitted among people who are late to get the vaccines or never have the vaccines.There’s no cure for HPV & Condom do not protect you against Hepatitis & HPV at all, but Only early vaccinations do. Most of the guys, girls, gays, ts and bi, (you see or have been with), have either one or both or three of those pathogens. If they never get their early vaccinations or they’re late or never get tested for HIV (and/or NOT on PrEP). A Lot of people don’t even know what they have or not aware of them.
AND THE MORE POPULAR A GIRL, THE MORE “ADMIRERS” THEY HAVE.  AS A RESULT OF LOTS OF “ADMIRERS” A.K.A “SEX”, THE MORE VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS THAT THEY HAVE. JUST PICTURE EACH GUY CHIPS IN WITH THEIR OWN STRAIN OF VIRUSES (HPV, HEP, OR POSSIBLY “HIV” TOO). SO, COUNT HOW MANY GUYS? 1? 10? 100?,  LET’S SAY “HPV”. DO YOU KNOW 14 MILLIONS NEW PEOPLE GET INFECTED BY HPV IN THE U.S EVERY YEAR (PER CDC). (AND THEY COULD BE YOUR TRICKS, HOOK UP FRIENDS, GIRLS/BOYS, GAYS, ESCORTS, SOMEONE’S HUSBAND/ WIFE ETC.)  (VICIOUS CYCLE - AND KEEP ON MULTIPLYING…) 👀🙃
AND OF COURSE, IF THEY NEVER HAVE EARLY VACCINATIONS OR IF THEY’RE LATE, OR WORSE IF THEY NEVER GOT VACCINATED AT ALL. THEY ALL BECOME “THE HOSTS” A.K.A “DEADLY CARRIERS”.  
BUT IF YOU GOT VACCINATED  (HPV, HEPATITIS ETC) SINCE YOU’RE 13 - 15 LIKE ME, YOU’RE GOOD. WELL, YOU’RE JUST MMM SLUTTY. THE BIGGEST SLUT OF ALL, AREN’T YOU? YES YOU ARE..😄 
AND AGAIN, ANYONE CAN SAY THEY HAD OR HAVE BEEN VACCINATED OR ON PrEP , BUT NO PROOF A.K.A “BLOWING SMOKE”. DON’T GET FOOLED.  IT’S A TREND MANY GIRLS OR GUYS USE NOWADAYS. ( TELL THEM TO SHOW YOU THE BOTTLES OF PREP (TRUVADA) THEY HAVE TAKEN, PRESCRIBED ON THEIR NAMES? ~ (WELL, WELL, WELL,  LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN, A PINOCCHIOOO…) 😉
IF YOU’RE ON PrEP, THAT’S VERY GOOD.  BUT IF YOU DON’T GET VACCINATED FOR HPV & HEPATITIS. YOUR PROTECTION IS NOT COMPLETE. HPV & HEPATITIS ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEM (teenagers, girls, boys, men, women, gay, bi, straight -everyone really without early vaccinations) - (The main cause of CERVICAL CANCER, ANAL CANCER, COCK, BALLS, MOUTH, THROAT CANCER, LIVER CYST, LIVER CIRRHOSIS, LIVER CANCER ETC). MANY HAVE HPV & HEPATITIS AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM, AND AGAIN HIV TOO.
PLUS MEN CAN BE CARRIERS OF THESE HPV VIRUSES (OF ANY TYPES). As CDC states, “Many men who get HPV(of any types) might not develop symptoms and the infection for a while (It’s like a ticking bomb), and become “the carriers”, spreading around everywhere (their spouse, partners, hook-ups/tricks, girls, boys, gays, escorts, massage parlors etc). However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, colons, Vagina, vulva, cervix,  mouth, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)”.
“CONDOMS DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM HPV VIRUSES & HEPATITIS A,B & C, ONLY EARLY VACCINES DO”. IF YOU’RE LATE TO GET THE HPV VACCINES, YOU’RE LATE TO THOSE HPV VIRUSES, YOU HAVE GOT. ONCE YOU GET THE HPV (OF ANY TYPES), IT STAYS, IN YOU FOREVER. AND CONDOMS CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU FROM HIV UP TO 70%, WITH 30% RISK. NEW MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH TO PEVENT HIV IS  “PrEP”.
According to CDC, Vaccine-preventable diseases cause long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death.Did You Know that?
Each year In the United States:1. Each year, an average of 226,000 people are hospitalized due to influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die of influenza and its complications, the majority are among adults.2. There were approximately 32,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2012. Of those cases, there were about 3,300 deaths.3. 800,000 to 1.4 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, with complications such as liver cancer.4. In the U.S., HPV causes about 17,000 cancers in women, and about 9,000 cancers in men each year. About 10,000 die each year from HPV related cancers.
5. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 50 men will receive a diagnosis of HIV infection at some point in their lifetimes. Over the course of their lifetimes, 1 in 15 black men/women will be diagnosed with HIV infection, as will 1 in 18 Hispanic/ Latino men/women, 1 in 25 white men/women, 1 in 30  Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander men/women,  1 in 50 American Indian/Alaska Native men/women. 
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT?? 
Did you ever kiss, lick, touch, suck, drink, sex (vagina, ass, oral), with other girl, guy, ts, escorts or anyone who do not get their early vaccinations and/or on PrEP ? If you did or do, you just have to. 
Only complete advance lab test (blood, urine & swabs) will let you know for sure. It’s better to know your body & health than Not. Only a fool ignores his own body or health. No matter whom you’re with (gf, bf, hook-ups, someone’s gf, bf, wife, husband, tricks,1 nightstand, college friends, gay, bi, straight, escorts, porn stars, massage parlors etc), in any intimate event involve with:
 1.Skin touching skin ~HPV (hands, lips, genitals, massages etc), and 
2.Body fluids ~Hep A,B & C (saliva, pre-cum, cum etc), or 
3. Sex, oral or penetration ~ HIV, HPV & Hep ( oral, rim, penetrations, cock, vagina, handjob etc).
AND TO GO ON WITH THE STORY, MMM COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BECOOOOS THEY CAN PREVENT CANCERS. ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

By Nathan Harker Deseret News @n8_harker   9:25 p.m. Updated: 14   
In a report by Yahoo Sports , the student government at Iowa State passed a resolution saying that it opposed the Big 12 potentially adding BYU to its conference. 
The resolution said the reason BYU shouldn't be admitted to the Big 12 was because of ""discriminatory policies and practices (that) are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12."" 
Th Iowa State student government issued this statement to the Ames Tribune: ""Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed. The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big 12 at this time."" 
Here is a tweet with the ISU Student Body President's official statement. In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0 — ISU StuGov President (@ISUStuGovPres) September 8, 2016 
BYU is reportedly among 11 finalists the Big 12 is considering adding to its conference if it does expand to 12 or 14 teams.

limelightbeta,9/9/2016 3:29,"Here are five Tigers who could make an impact in Saturday’s game
With week one’s heartbreaking loss to BYU behind them, the Arizona Wildcats turn their attention to their first home game this Saturday. The opponent? The Grambling State Tigers.
The Tigers ripped off a 72-12 victory over the Virginia University of Lynchburg Dragons last week. They have a lot of speed on offense and do have big play capability. We should expect to see some zone-read offense from them as well. For some additional information on the matchup this week, Ronnie Stoffle wrote a first look.
Now let’s take a look at some potential impact players for Grambling:
Trevon Cherry, QB (No. 15)
Cherry is one of the quarterbacks Arizona might see on Saturday and is the ""pocket passer"", so to speak. He is a sophomore, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have talent. He has a pretty decent arm with accuracy and might test the secondary early on. Last week he went 11-for-15 for 140 yards and two touchdowns.
Devante Kincade, QB (No. 1)
Kincade is another quarterback Arizona should expect to see. He is an Ole Miss transfer, and a pretty talented dual-threat QB. There’s not much to speak of in terms of his accuracy, but he’s definitely a playmaker with his legs, especially on zone-read plays. If the Wildcat defense can get pressure on him and contain him, they might be able to force some errant throws. Last week, Kincade went 10-for-18 for 107 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. Running the ball, he had 139 yards on four carries and two touchdowns.
Chad Williams, WR (No. 10)
Williams was the Tigers’ leading receiver in 2015, tallying 62 catches for 1,012 and 10 touchdowns. He is a big target, measuring 6-foot-2 and 193 pounds. He did not record any stats last week and I would kind of be surprised if he plays this week. On Sunday September 4, Williams and two other males were arrested for marijuana and possession of firearms on LSU’s campus. I haven’t seen any update on his punishment but I don’t exactly see him getting playing time this weekend. It isn’t fully out of the question though.
Martez Carter, RB (No. 4)
Carter received second team All-SWAC honors as a sophomore last year after putting up some nice stats. He had 111 carries for 876 yards and nine rushing touchdowns. Carter also had 12 catches for 134 yards and four receiving touchdowns. This is impressive production given his size, which is 5-foot-8, 175 pounds. Last week, he had three carries for 78 yards and no touchdowns, plus a four-yard reception. I expect him to get more carries against the Wildcats.
Guy Stallworth, DB (No. 29)
Stallworth, a senior, earned first team All-SWAC honors as a junior and is an anchor for Grambling’s secondary. At 6-foot-3, 215 pounds, he is a DB who has great length and size. I expect him to potentially make some plays against Arizona’s smaller receivers and possibly be flying all over the field. Last year he had 56 tackles, 4.0 TFL, 1.0 sacks, and two interceptions.

Living together in mud: New bivalve species dwelling on a sea cucumber discovered in Japan 
Posted: 07 Sep 2016 09:00 PM PDT
Most bivalves live in sand or mud or attached to rock surface. However, a new bivalve species described from Japan lives on a sea cucumber that burrows in mudflats. This species is attached to the host by thin threads and uses host burrows as shelter from predators. This species, published in the open-access journal ZooKeys, is one of the smallest species in the genus, which is probably an adaptation to a narrow host burrow.

Posted: 07 Sep 2016 09:00 PM PDT
A Johns Hopkins University researcher noticed the bats he works with cocked their heads to the side, just like his pet pug. As the article publishing in open-access journal PLOS Biology details, using high-tech recording devices, Wohlgemuth determined that a bat's fetching head waggles and ear wiggles sync with the animal's sonar vocalizations to help it hunt. The finding demonstrates how movement in bats can enhance signals used by senses like sight and hearing. Yellow or black, large or small? Ant color and body size respond strongly to environment

While these were all good meaning students, this was definitely beyond the scope of their mission. Whether or not BYU joins the conference has no implications on the Iowa State campus environment. The Big 12 is not a group of schools with the same like minded values and beliefs. They are an athletic conference, and if they want to champion diversity they need to tolerate ALL viewpoints, from within and without. Pointing fingers at BYU's policies will not help the students within the university and BYU's policies won't affect any of the Big 12 member institutions anyway.

arkansasmatters.com,9/9/2016 3:41,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

KSL.com,9/9/2016 3:44,"SALT LAKE CITY — Josh Romney said Thursday it's tough for him and his father, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to witness what may be ""permanent damage"" to the Republican Party from Donald Trump's candidacy.
The concern, Josh Romney told members of the BYU Management Society gathered at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, is that the 2016 GOP nominee has hurt the party's image with minority voters because of his statements on race and religion.
""His Hispanic and black outreach has been minimal at best and harmful in many ways,"" Romney said, noting the billionaire businessman's efforts to win a larger percentage of white voters than past GOP candidates is not a winning one.
That's because, Romney said, his father ""would have won by a bigger landslide than Ronald Regan did against Jimmy Carter"" had the nation's demographics not changed since 1980 because he received a higher percentage of the white vote than Reagan.
Republicans have to recognize the dramatic shift in the country's makeup, he said, and Trump's talking of deporting people in the country illegally, making Mexico pay to build a border wall and banning Muslims have been harmful.
""So the concern is what Donald has done. Has it caused permanent damage to the Republican brand and the Republican Party among those minorities? Or is it something we can recover from? I'm not sure,"" Romney said.
He called it ""astonishing"" that Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's pick for president, actually won their primary races and will be on the ballot in November.
What needs to happen, Romney said, is for political parties ""to revamp next time, nominate people who stand for something, that will bring us together, unite us as a country, that will tackle hard issues. I believe that can happen.""

Wednesday was supposed to be the day Donald Trump clarified his immigration stance. But in a key speech on that subject, he misstated facts about immigration policy, life for those in the country illegally and their impact on the U.S. economy.
This election year is going to be hard, especially on his father, said Romney, one of Mitt Romney's five sons.
Mitt Romney slammed Trump as a phony and a fraud in a high-profile speech at the University of Utah just before the state's March GOP presidential preference caucus vote, likely helping Trump finish a distant third.
The two-time presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor has said he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and has said he's considering the Libertarian Party ticket headed by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson.
On Wednesday, Romney tweeted for the first time in two months, telling Twitter followers he hopes voters get to see Johnson and his running mate, another former Massachusetts governor, William Weld, participate in this fall's debates.
I hope voters get to see former GOP Governors Gary Johnson and Bill Weld on the debate stages this fall.
- Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 7, 2016
That's fueled speculation about a possible Romney endorsement, as has a recent meeting between a top Romney adviser in 2012 and a new entry into the presidential race, Evan McMullin, a Utah native and former CIA officer.
Josh Romney said his father would ""love to be there in the fight. He was really hoping to see a young star rise out of the Republican darkness"" after toying briefly with a third White House bid.
""It's tough and it's frustrating. We still talk about it a lot. He cares a lot about this country and about the party,"" Josh Romney said. ""It's tough to see what the party is going through.""
Josh Romney called himself a believer in the Republican Party of Lincoln and Reagan, ""not Donald Trump,"" and said he hopes the GOP ""can remake our brand a little bit next go-round and be more inclusive and more optimistic.""
Josh Romney, the president of a Utah-based real estate investment firm, has said he is considering a run for governor in 2020, but Thursday told a reporter he hasn't ""made a decision on anything, but I'm considering a lot of options.""

Albuquerque Journal,9/9/2016 3:46,"Former All-American pitcher Reeder joins UNM softball staff
By ABQJournal News Staff
Thursday, September 8th, 2016 at 5:30pm
Kim Reeder has joined the University of New Mexico softball coaching the staff, the school announced on Sept. 8, 2016. (UNM photo)
.......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........
 Kim Reeder, a former All-America pitcher at Ohio State and a coach the last two years with the Central Coast Girls Athletic Foundation, has joined the University of New Mexico softball staff as an assistant coach.
""Kim is going to an instrumental part of our staff,"" said UNM head coach Erica Beach. ""She brings a wealth of knowledge and an incredible passion for the game. She is a dynamic coach, who makes every player better and I am so happy to have her as part of the Lobo family.""
Reeder replaces Jessica Garcia, who is leaving the program to attend graduate school.
Beach was coaching at Ohio State when Reeder played there (2005-09). Reeder, who has been a pitching instructor for over 10 years, will come into the program to help out with the Lobo pitchers which will allow Beach to expand her responsibilities within the team. She has helped pitchers get to many colleges at the next level, including Santa Clara, BYU, Slippery Rock, Washington Mount Vernon Nazarene and New Mexico.
Reeder not only has a significant coaching background, but she is very well rounded in the recruiting area. Along with coaching duties at Central Coast Athletics, she was the recruiting coordinator and liaison sending players to Division I colleges, including Portland State, UNM, Western Washington, Sacramento State and Santa Clara in the last year.
Reeder spent two seasons in professional softball, playing overseas in the Italian Softball League. In 222 innings of work in the circle, she had a 1.26 earned run average.

LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION, SHALL WE? 
COMPLETELY TESTED!!!
 ~ON 8/2/2016 (CLEAN AND CLEAR). So, have you ever got yourself tested at all???
The only one girl with “The best magic” of All…
‘The one & only cleanest , healthiest than yo’momma, yo’ wife , yo’ gf and you, combined….”
I GOT TESTED (BLOOD & URINE) & SWAB FOR MOUTH, ASS, WITH ALL COMPLETE ADVANCE LAB TEST, FOR ALL STDs/ HIV, Hep C etc (CLEAN AND CLEAR).
AND I’M ON PrEP ~ ( Meaning: Stds free and hiv free and no hepatitis A, B & C. And you can only be on PrEP if you have been completely tested, STDs FREE, NO health issues whatsoever (esp. liver, kidney & bones) and PrEP can only be prescribed by your doctor. If you’re HIV positive, you can’t be on PrEP (too little too late, the ship has sailed- And Oh Danny boy starts to play Uh Oh..). 
AND GET VACCINATED FOR:
1.PNEUMOCOCCAL 23-VALENT,
2.HPV (get the gardasil9 - New HPV Vaccine)
3.TDAP,
4.MENINGOCOCCAL
5. PLUS, IMMUNE OF HEPATITIS A/B TOO..
6. GOT MY COLONOSCOPY & COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS ETC..
DO YOU KNOW? VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. WELL, NOW YO DO…
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT ??
“THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE , THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD TO BANG, FIRST OF ALL, ON PrEP AND EARLY VACCINATIONS, AT LEAST  FOR EARLY HPV & HEPATITIS  (All 3 doses). There’s a newest HPV vaccine, gardasil9.
Three types of pathogens of concern, are Hepatitis , Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is much more contagious than HIV.  While HPV is the easiest and most common one, transmitted among people who are late to get the vaccines or never have the vaccines.There’s no cure for HPV & Condom do not protect you against Hepatitis & HPV at all, but Only early vaccinations do. Most of the guys, girls, gays, ts and bi, (you see or have been with), have either one or both or three of those pathogens. If they never get their early vaccinations or they’re late or never get tested for HIV (and/or NOT on PrEP). A Lot of people don’t even know what they have or not aware of them.
AND THE MORE POPULAR A GIRL OR GUY, THE MORE “ADMIRERS” THEY HAVE.  AS A RESULT OF LOTS OF “ADMIRERS” A.K.A “SEX”, THE MORE VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS THAT THEY HAVE. JUST PICTURE EACH GUY CHIPS IN WITH THEIR OWN STRAIN OF VIRUSES (HPV, HEP, OR POSSIBLY “HIV” TOO). SO, COUNT HOW MANY GUYS? 1? 10? 100?,  LET’S SAY “HPV”. DO YOU KNOW 14 MILLIONS NEW PEOPLE GET INFECTED BY HPV IN THE U.S EVERY YEAR (PER CDC). (AND THEY COULD BE YOUR TRICKS, HOOK UP FRIENDS, GIRLS/BOYS, GAYS, ESCORTS, SOMEONE’S HUSBAND/ WIFE ETC.)  (VICIOUS CYCLE - AND KEEP ON MULTIPLYING…) 👀🙃
AND OF COURSE, IF THEY NEVER HAVE EARLY VACCINATIONS OR IF THEY’RE LATE, OR WORSE IF THEY NEVER GOT VACCINATED AT ALL. THEY ALL BECOME “THE HOSTS” A.K.A “DEADLY CARRIERS”. 
BUT IF YOU GOT VACCINATED  (HPV, HEPATITIS ETC) SINCE YOU’RE 13 - 15 LIKE ME, YOU’RE GOOD. WELL, YOU’RE JUST MMM SLUTTY, THE BIGGEST SLUT OF ALL, AREN’T YOU???  YES YOU ARE..😄 
AND AGAIN, ANYONE CAN SAY THEY HAD OR HAVE BEEN VACCINATED OR ON PrEP , BUT NO PROOF A.K.A “BLOWING SMOKE”. DON’T GET FOOLED.  IT’S A TREND MANY GIRLS OR GUYS USE NOWADAYS. ( TELL THEM TO SHOW YOU THE BOTTLES OF PREP (TRUVADA) THEY HAVE TAKEN, PRESCRIBED ON THEIR NAMES? ~ (WELL, WELL, WELL,  LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN, A PINOCCHIOOO…) 😉
IF YOU’RE ON PrEP, THAT’S VERY GOOD.  BUT IF YOU DON’T GET VACCINATED FOR HPV & HEPATITIS. YOUR PROTECTION IS NOT COMPLETE. HPV & HEPATITIS ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEM (teenagers, girls, boys, men, women, gay, bi, straight -everyone really without early vaccinations) - (The main cause of CERVICAL CANCER, ANAL CANCER, COCK, BALLS, MOUTH, THROAT CANCER, LIVER CYST, LIVER CIRRHOSIS, LIVER CANCER ETC). MANY HAVE HPV & HEPATITIS AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM, AND AGAIN HIV TOO.
PLUS MEN CAN BE CARRIERS OF THESE HPV VIRUSES (OF ANY TYPES). As CDC states, “Many men who get HPV(of any types) might not develop symptoms and the infection for a while (It’s like a ticking bomb), and become “the carriers”, spreading around everywhere (their spouse, partners, hook-ups/tricks, girls, boys, gays, escorts, massage parlors etc). However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, colons, Vagina, vulva, cervix,  mouth, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)”.
“CONDOMS DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM HPV VIRUSES & HEPATITIS A,B & C, ONLY EARLY VACCINES DO”. IF YOU’RE LATE TO GET THE HPV VACCINES, YOU’RE LATE TO THOSE HPV VIRUSES, YOU HAVE GOT. ONCE YOU GET THE HPV (OF ANY TYPES), IT STAYS, IN YOU FOREVER. AND CONDOMS CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU FROM HIV UP TO 70%, WITH 30% RISK. NEW MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH TO PEVENT HIV IS  “PrEP”.
According to CDC, Vaccine-preventable diseases cause long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death.Did You Know that?
Each year In the United States:1. Each year, an average of 226,000 people are hospitalized due to influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die of influenza and its complications, the majority are among adults.2. There were approximately 32,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2012. Of those cases, there were about 3,300 deaths.3. 800,000 to 1.4 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, with complications such as liver cancer.4. In the U.S., HPV causes about 17,000 cancers in women, and about 9,000 cancers in men each year. About 10,000 die each year from HPV related cancers.
5. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 50 men will receive a diagnosis of HIV infection at some point in their lifetimes. Over the course of their lifetimes, 1 in 15 black men/women will be diagnosed with HIV infection, as will 1 in 18 Hispanic/ Latino men/women, 1 in 25 white men/women, 1 in 30  Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander men/women,  1 in 50 American Indian/Alaska Native men/women. 
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT?? 
Did you ever kiss, lick, touch, suck, drink, sex (vagina, ass, oral), with other girl, guy, ts, escorts or anyone who do not get their early vaccinations and/or on PrEP ? If you did or do, you just have to. 
Only complete advance lab test (blood, urine & swabs) will let you know for sure. It’s better to know your body & health than Not. Only a fool ignores his own body or health. No matter whom you’re with (gf, bf, hook-ups, someone’s gf, bf, wife, husband, tricks,1 nightstand, college friends, gay, bi, straight, escorts, porn stars, massage parlors etc), in any intimate event involve with:
 1.Skin touching skin ~HPV (hands, lips, genitals, massages etc), and 
2.Body fluids ~Hep A,B & C (saliva, pre-cum, cum etc), or 
3. Sex, oral or penetration ~ HIV, HPV & Hep ( oral, rim, penetrations, cock, vagina, handjob etc).
AND TO GO ON WITH THE STORY, MMM COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BECOOOOS THEY CAN PREVENT CANCERS. ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

Gia has an obsession with food. She can and will find anything edible within or out of  her reach and claim it as her own. She will present as having opposable thumbs in the process, truly.
So, this was her score last evening:  two bags of chewy treats, 1 small bag of dog biscuits (found in the car while her owners were having a beer in a Moab bar- we didn't notice the ripped paper, empty of contents, til this morning). AND how about a container of leftover fries from the front seat? (Confiscated while we quick stopped at the camp bathroom on the way back from said bar).  Now, this far exceeds her usual take and she was in a food coma today, helpful since we had a long drive.
Oh, these guys:
Tom and Tate, our camping neighbors from Ohio.  These two are great guys; friends since early elementary school, they planned this week to ATV all over the canyons. They'll go up walls, hug high ledges. It sparks them and challenges them; they love it. They are hysterical, told us stories that made us laugh and cry. They  love their wives, kids. They are close as brothers and sometimes want to clobber each other. We were sad to say goodbye to them this morning.
You can see Gia has an inappropriate interest in Tom's food.
So, we break camp late because we keep talking to Tom and Tate; it's 10:30 when we head out. It's HOT; the desert sun is relentless.  
Wow. A chunk of our 6-7 hr. drive is barren land. There are changes from mountains to hills, pastures of green and gold pop up and then pass. As we drive along, the landscape changes, from stark to green then to less texture and color.
(Sorry! They uploaded in reverse order!)
We see tons of wind turbines very near to the road, large and small. They are a dramatic touch to such plain surroundings.  We drive through Provo,Utah, home of Brigham Young University. Talk about colorless- oh my. Lots of strip plazas dotted with beautiful old western architecture. Lots of clean-cut students looking more subdued than those at UC-Boulder (:    We see signs for LDS Philanthropies, LDS temples.  
Traveling on, the route directs us through Park City, Utah, skiing for the skilled and home of Sundance Film Festival.  We start seeing signs SNOW AVALANCHE AREA frequently along the road.  It's lovely when you don't think of the snow avalanches. 
And then, we returned to Wyoming, THE MEAT STATE (Carmen's term).  The sign actually says Welcome to Wyoming: Forever West.  We proceed a short while longer and get onto I-80.
There's a prairie wind, strong and continual. Flashing signs on I-80 warn of gusts to 45.  There's nothing blocking the wind, it just blows and blows.  If you're on a flat road that goes on and on, it requires a real focus. It's hard sometimes to tell what lane oncoming cars are in; things can appear distorted, blurry.  Note to self: eyes open, concentrate.  Shut off Hamilton.
We turn off 80 to head to Kemmerer, WY before heading to Grand Tetons tomorrow. Hmmmm...are we supposed to go left or right off the exit??  The answer was obvious as there was nowhere to go if you turned right:
We pull into the Best Western Fossil Inn around 5:30. We are whipped. There are BEDS. It's COMFORTABLE. Gia's glad as she's been sleeping in dirt for 3 days:
There are few things that feel as good as a hot shower, let me say that!
Went to a local diner type place for dinner; lots a cowboy hats, string ties, shirts, boots.  A woman at a corner table calls her mom and is yelling into the receiver as her mom doesn't hear very well. The Asian waiter walks over and talks to mom, too. He knows her. The couple behind us stop on their way out to check on mom, too.
After all, it is the #2 rated restaurant in Kemmerer, Wyoming.
Good night, all.

LocalSYR,9/9/2016 3:57,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 12:21PM
Updated 09/08 2016 12:21PM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

KSL.com,9/9/2016 3:59,"PROVO — If Hunter Marshall had a little more time on his hands, he’d spend it fly fishing on the Provo River.
But the avid outdoorsman from Georgia has been pretty busy lately.
Marshall made his Division I debut in BYU’s 18-16 win over Arizona , when the former Snow College tight end caught two passes for 29 yards in his first Division I appearance.
'I think the biggest thing for us at the tight end position is finishing and fighting,' said Marshall, who redshirted one season at Georgia Tech before serving a two-year mission for the LDS Church. 'That’s what (tight ends coach Steve) Clark talks to us about: fight, fight, fight. For myself, I definitely feel I can improve on my blocking game.
'But overall, I thought it was a solid performance.'
Veterans like Jamaal Williams and Taysom Hill were the focus of Arizona’s defensive gameplay, and they stand to figure into their fair share in the scouting report as Utah prepares to host the Cougars at 5:30 p.m. MDT Saturday in the first regular-season rivalry game since 2013.
But Marshall, Tanner Balderree, Troy Hinds and the rest of the tight ends hope to see more action as the season progresses, as well.
'Of course we’ll play it game-by-game and do what works,' Marshall said. 'If our number is called, then we’ve got to make plays. That’s the biggest thing. We’re definitely incorporated into the blocking scheme, and we’re always working on that.'
There are always improvements to be made just two weeks into the season. But offensive coordinator Ty Detmer seemed pleased in his first collegiate playcalling experience.
'I’m happy with it,' Detmer said. 'We had some opportunities to put it on them when it was 15-3, and we slipped up in the red zone and on third down. Those were drive killers at that time. But overall, we moved the ball really well. We had a lot of players, and we did what we had planned as coordinators.'
The blocking scheme was a major X-factor heading into the season-opener at Arizona. Graduate transfers Andrew Eide and Keyan Norman made their first FBS starts on the offensive line since transferring from Southern Utah, joining six other players who debuted in the first 11-man rotation of their careers.
'Since three of us weren’t in spring ball, we’re still learning to jell as an offensive line,' said Eide, a former all-Big Sky honoree for the Thunderbirds. 'We made some errors with our footwork, and Arizona stunted a lot so we had to make split-second decisions that we weren’t ready for at that speed.
'But luckily we have an amazing running back and an amazing quarterback who did what good backs do: They made their offensive line right a lot of the times.'
Related Story
Jonah Trinnaman was so hyped for BYU football’s season opener against Arizona, he laid out what he was going to wear long before kickoff at University of Phoenix Stadium.
Eide knows the line will have to be even better to face a stout Utah front-seven that includes arguably the best defensive line in the country in Hunter Dimick, Lowell Lotulelei, Kylie Fitts and Filipo Mokofisi.
'They’re all guys that aren’t afraid to hit,' Eide said of the front-seven. 'They like to hit pretty hard; when they blitz, they really bring it. They aren’t going to try to evade us.'
Marshall is excited to add his name to the storied rivalry some call the Holy War. But mostly, he is excited to play a strong team in Week 2.
'We’re really looking forward to playing a great team that will help us get better,' he said. 'That’s the wonderful thing about great competition: It forces you to play at a higher level and makes you a better player. That will be a great thing going into our season.'

• This is the first meeting between the Ole Miss and Wofford football teams.
• The Rebels have won 11 of 12 games against FCS foes since 2005, including five straight and a 4-0 mark under head coach Hugh Freeze.
• With a record 57,200 season tickets sold, Ole Miss has sold out of season tickets for the fourth straight year.

OLE MISS HEAD COACH HUGH FREEZE
Hugh Freeze (Southern Miss, 1992) is in his fifth season at the Ole Miss helm. He inherited a team that went 2-10 and winless in SEC games in 2011 and has led the Rebels to four straight bowl games, including back-to-back 'New Year’s Six' bowl berths the last two seasons. He’s the first coach to lead Ole Miss to four straight bowls since John Vaught, and he’s the only Rebel coach to accomplish that feat in his first four seasons at the helm. A 2014 finalist for the Bear Bryant Award and Dodd Trophy, Freeze owns a 34-19 mark in Oxford and a career record of 64-26. His .642 winning percentage at Ole Miss is the second-best of any Rebel coach in the last 100 years. He was named the University’s 37th head football coach on Dec. 5, 2011, coming to Oxford after one year as head coach at Arkansas State where he led the Red Wolves to a 10-2 season and the 2011 Sun Belt Conference title and was tabbed Sun Belt Coach of the Year. It is his second stint at Ole Miss, as he was a member of the Rebel coaching staff from 2005-07, including the final two seasons as an assistant coach and recruiting coordinator with two of the top classes in school history.
WOFFORD HEAD COACH MIKE AYERS
Mike Ayers (Georgetown, Ky., 1974) is in his 29th year as the Wofford head coach. With a record of 188-132-1 at Wofford, Ayers is the winningest coach in school history. His 199 career wins over 31+ years also ranks sixth in the FCS among active coaches. Throughout his time at Wofford, Ayers has been named Southern Conference Coach of the Year three times by his peers (2000, 2003, 2007) and four times by the media (2000, 2002, 2003, 2010). In 2002, he was named the Division I-AA National Coach of the Year by College Sporting News and was runner-up for the Eddie Robinson Award. One year later, Ayers won the Robinson Award as the Division I-AA National Coach of the Year. With 28 years under his belt, Ayers is the longest tenured coach in the Southern Conference as well as the state of South Carolina. Prior to serving as Wofford’s head coach, Ayers was the head coach at East Tennessee State for three seasons (1985-87), earning the promotion after spending two years (1983-83) as the school’s defensive coordinator. Ayers made his first stop at Wofford in 1980 as an assistant, coaching the defense from 1980-82. Ayers began his career at his alma mater Georgetown (Ky.) in 1974 before coaching at Newberry College and Richmond until he joined the Wofford staff.
WOFFORD SCOUTING REPORT
Wofford is 1-0 after beating Tennessee Tech on the road 21-7 to start its 2016 season. Having played on Thursday night (Sept. 1), the Terriers enter Saturday’s matchup on eight days rest. Relying on the triple option, Wofford is a team that likes to run the football. Last season, Wofford ranked fourth in FCS in rushing, averaging 300.0 yards per game. In Thursday’s season opener, the Terriers rushed for 346 yards while only passing for 42 yards. The 2016 backfield is highlighted by senior halfback Will Gay and senoir fullback Lorenzo Long. Gay rushed for a team-high 117 yards in Wofford’s first game, and Long, a second team All-Southern Conference honoree in 2015, finished with 92 yards on the ground. Taking over for projected starter Evan Jacks, who was sidelined with a knee injury, quarterback Brad Butler had 120 yards of total offense (90 rushing, 30 passing) in the win. On defense, senior safety Jaleel Green leads the Terriers as the reigning Southern Conference Defensive Player of the Week. Green made five tackles and hauled in a red zone interception late in the fourth quarter, helping Wofford hang on to its season-opening victory. Entering week two, Wofford is receiving votes in the FCS Coaches Poll.
OLE MISS-WOFFORD CONNECTION
• Ole Miss backup tight end Hunter Thurley was a two-year member of Wofford’s football team (2012-13) as a defensive lineman.
REBELS VERSUS FCS OPPONENTS
• Ole Miss has won five straight games against FCS foes (Southern Illinois 2011, Central Arkansas 2012, Southeast Missouri 2013, Presbyterian 2014, UT Martin 2015) since dropping the 2010 season opener to Jacksonville State in double overtime.
• Since 2005, the Rebels have won 11 of 12 games against FCS teams.
• Ole Miss is 4-0 against FCS teams under head coach Hugh Freeze.
IN THE POLLS
• Ole Miss is 18th in this week’s AP poll and 19th in the coaches poll.

BIG LEAD NOT ENOUGH FOR REBELS IN ORLANDO
Ole Miss led by 22 (28-6) against the No. 4 team in the nation Monday, but it wasn’t enough to put away the Florida State Seminoles in a 45-34 season-opening loss. The lead was the Rebels’ biggest against a top-five opponent in the Hugh Freeze era. FSU reeled off 33 unanswered points before Ole Miss scored to make it 39-34 early in the fourth quarter. But the Seminoles, behind five sacks, put too much pressure on the Ole Miss passing game for the Rebels to regain the advantage. It was the first season-opening loss for the Rebels since 2011, the year before Freeze arrived in Oxford.
TWO BIG BLOWS
Ole Miss suffered two big blows in the season opener in Orlando, losing starting CB Ken Webster and backup RB Eric Swinney to left knee injuries that could end both of their seasons. Webster was replaced by senior CB Carlos Davis, while Swinney’s snaps were taken by junior RB Eugene Brazley.

LasVegasNow,9/9/2016 4:04,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 09:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 09:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

September 8, 2016 by Natasha Helfer Parker Leave a Comment Image found on Bing.com – free to share and use page. The recent article regarding gender and sexual orientation posted in The New Atlantis has started a flurry of discussion in religiously conservative circles. When talking with some colleagues within the sexual field about how we can respond to this, one stated, “It’s crap. That’s the only response it deserves.” And I agree. Yet I know full well, that within Mormon culture, many have a propensity to pay attention to these types of articles that will confirm religious biases. And they see it as “proof” in support of a religious document such as the Family Proclamation . This is what the organization Mormon Women Stand (not officially affiliated with the LDS Church) has done as it has embraced the Atlantis article (which is not supported by “science” as it claims). This is dangerous. Dangerous because it has the power to impact so many lives in negative ways. And dangerous because biased information becomes doctrinal folklore – affecting the lives of our members. It takes mental health professionals and educators, such as myself and many of my colleagues, years if not decades to undo this type of damage (because folklore doesn’t tend to be corrected over the pulpit and overwhelming evidence to the contrary is ignored). We have known for a long time that sexual orientation runs on a spectrum (i.e. Kinsey Scale ) and there can be shifts to orientation throughout a life span for some (more often women than men). And yet, this does not correlate to the many assumptions being made by the MWS post for example. This type of information is spun to meet the needs of the religious bias, and discounts information that is vital to the mental health and quality of life of millions (my colleague, Jim Pfaus will be providing a guest post addressing some of these things tomorrow). 
I am so thankful that Dr. Mikle South of BYU wrote the following rebuttal. And I agree with his ending statement: STOP SHARING THIS ARTICLE! Do not be a part of distributing false data that has such harmful consequences. 
The following guest post is copied here from Rational Faiths with permission: 
By Dr. Mikle South, Associate Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Brigham Young University 
In the past couple of days, a number of friends have asked for my opinion on a recent blogpost from Mormon Women Stand (MWS) entitled “Groundbreaking Research on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Backs up the Family Proclamation and Teachings of Prophets” with the subtitle “Almost Everything the Media Tells You About Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Is Wrong.” 
The MWS blogpost reviews a recent article in a publication called The New Atlantis which claims to have definitively shown “that some of the most frequently heard claims about sexuality and gender are not supported by scientific evidence.” The upshot of their claim is that homosexuality has no biological basis and that LGBTQ people have deliberately chosen their sexual orientation. There is an additional subtext discounting the role of discrimination against LGBTQ people as an underlying factor for their high rates of depression and suicide. 
I have now heard about a number of well-meaning LDS bishops who have sent a link for this post to members of their flock concerned about the experience of LGBTQ youth in the church, with a note along the lines of “so here is what science has proven and you should let your worries go.” Unfortunately, the MWS blog post has things all wrong, and has the potential to cause extensive harm. 
Let me state my agenda upfront. First, as a mental health researcher and a practicing psychologist, my highest priority is to help improve human welfare. Because LGBTQ youth and adults—especially those rejected by family and close friends–are at increased risk for poor health and mental health outcomes, including suicide, I have extra concern for their welfare. I believe that is why so many friends have asked for my opinion on this, and why I want to respond. 
Second, I am not an expert regarding the science of sexuality. I am aware of substantial evidence supporting a strong biological influence on sexuality, but the nature of science makes it impossible to ever “prove” anything one way or the other. My commentary is not about whether sexuality is innate or a choice. Rather, my point is to examine the accuracy and the consequences of the MWS blogpost. In brief, I have three concerns. The original New Atlantis report does not represent good science, despite its claim that “this report is about science and medicine, nothing more and nothing less.” I examined the original article in terms of standard benchmarks for establishing acceptable quality of scientific research, as recognized by other scientists, universities, and funding agencies. These benchmarks provide an important context about whether other scientists find that the research methods are adequate and the conclusions are appropriate to the findings. The article does not meet any of these benchmarks. Specifically, it was not peer reviewed prior to publication. The journal itself, The New Atlantis , does not appear in the Journal Citation Reports database, the premier source for tracking how often other scientists cite articles from that journal. While the authors of the The New Atlantis article criticize the findings of other scientists who used acceptable methods, they themselves did not use acceptable statistical techniques such as meta-analysis, and the research they review is highly selective. Much of the MWS blogpost is cut-and-pasted material from a scholar employed by the Heritage Foundation named Ryan T. Anderson. Anderson received his PhD in Economic Policy but is known primarily as a political philosopher. He does not have a background in psychology or psychiatry and is thus an unusual choice to rely on for a scientific review of the research. Anderson’s pick of entertainer Lady Gaga as a primary representative of the scientific viewpoint was equally puzzling. The “research” cited in The New Atlantis report is not groundbreaking, rather it is a lengthy recycling of previous arguments. Science as a discipline is imperfect, but concluding that the body of work on the nature of sexuality is “wrong” is simply not tenable–and an affront to the scientific method of inquiry, hypothesis-testing, and replication. Science is a dynamic entity and putting a definitive “stop” to the process is inappropriate. The link between The New Atlantis report and The Family Proclamation is tenuous and overstated. While the author of the MWS blogpost repeatedly affirms that the findings of the report support the truths contained in the LDS church’s Family Proclamation , my own view is that this is a misappropriation of church materials to suit her own bias. I first note considerable confusion over the use of the term “gender.” In psychology and biology, “sex” is used to refer to the biological characteristics of a person’s sex organs, i.e. the plumbing they are born with (while also acknowledging that, for a few babies, this is not clear cut at birth). “Gender” refers to a societal construction of what it means to be “masculine” or “feminine.” The terms are often used interchangeably, but in this context it is important to know what is meant. The LDS church usually uses “gender” to mean what psychologists and biologists typically call “sex.” One could thus accurately interpret the Family Proclamation as saying “Boys are born as boys and they will always be boys. Girls are born girls and will always be girls.” The author of the MWS post has chosen to interpret this statement from the Proclamation as a statement against the biological nature of sexual preference, but this is only a matter of opinion. To claim this viewpoint as factual is vastly overstated and also in contradiction to numerous recent statements on the issue by LDS general authorities. Most importantly, the content and the tone of this post focus much more on blaming the victims of discrimination–our LGBTQ brothers and sisters–rather than encouraging more acceptance and love for everyone. LGBTQ youth and adults, whether LDS and not, suffer immensely from discrimination and rejection. If you have doubts about this, please talk to any LGBTQ friends, family members, or neighbors. They will tell you multiple examples of small and big ways they have been ill-treated on account of their sexuality. LDS members are repeatedly counseled to seek out the afflicted as Christ did, to “succor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.” No one but God knows the balance of innate biological versus environmental influence (including trauma, abuse, as well as societal pressures) versus some sort of “choice” for each individual’s sexuality. It is inappropriate for any of us to claim we know better, and whatever our beliefs on the matter, it is inappropriate to discriminate against others on account of it, The take-away conclusion of the MWS blogpost is this: “If you’re LGBTQ and you are feeling rejected, it’s only because you were mentally ill to start with. Besides, your choices about sexuality are your own fault anyway so don’t ask us to assuage your tender feelings.” My own view is that this post and similar writings promulgate feelings of rejection that further contribute to the epidemic of depression and suicide among our LGBTQ neighbors and friends. I encourage us to have much more of an “Is it I?” mentality about what we can do, individually, to love others as Christ did. Christ repeatedly had harsher words for the self-righteous who judged others poorly, while reaching out to and serving those whom the ruling righteous judged as sinners. For these reasons and others, I plead for responsible people to stop sharing the MWS blogpost, the source post from Dr. Anderson, or The New Atlantis article which at its core is a scientific travesty. In contrast to the provocative title of the MWS post, the article in question does not represent valid or groundbreaking research, does not factually affirm the divinity of the Family Proclamation , and it has more potential to increase rejection and discrimination than it does to encourage Christlike love for LGBTQ brothers and sisters. Instead, I recommend that all of us ask ourselves: how can I be more welcoming and loving? It might help to seek out an LGBTQ friend, family member or neighbor and ask for their opinion on the same question. Listen, don’t judge, and help make the world a better place for everyone. 
Important notes These views are entirely my own and are not intended to represent the viewpoint of my employer, the church I belong to, or any friends or family members. I sent a request more than a week ago to the Mormon Women Stand site to respond to my concerns but have not heard back from them. As stated at the outset, this article addresses the accuracy and tone of the MWS blogpost and its sources and does not comment on the nature of sexuality and sexual orientation, or the structure of marriage. I suggest to the moderator that any comments on this question are not germane to my article and should be removed.

Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Iowa State student gov against adding BYU to Big 12 By Nathan Cunningham/FanSided via Lawless Republic Sep 9, 2016 at 12:25a ET 0Shares 
The student government of Iowa State is officially against adding BYU to the Big 12 Conference, passing a resolution that will be sent to the Presidents of all Big 12 institutions. But will it make a difference for the Cougars? What happened? 
Iowa State student senator Abhijit Patma introduced a resolution against the inclusion of BYU to the Big 12 on Wednesday night. 
The Iowa State student government passed it 21-6, determining that – according to the Iowa State Daily – “BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12.” 
Now the resolution will be sent to the President of each Big 12 school. 
It’s difficult to break down issues like this because it mixes sports and fandom with religion and politics, but the crux of it all seems to be this: What are BYU’s rights? 
BYU has a right as a private institution to do whatever it would like to do. While some policies may, to some, seem abrasive and unnecessary (and perhaps even discriminatory), BYU still has a right to do them. On the flipside, any individual also has a right to dislike and boycott BYU – but they don’t have a right to change the university. “You make change by embracing people… This resolution is not the way you make change. We don’t make change by excluding people.” – Cole Staudt, ISU student gov president 
Also, it doesn’t really seem like this is the ISU student government’s fight. They certainly have every right to have an opinion, and to make it public, but who are they to determine that BYU is bad and needs to change? Frankly, it doesn’t appear to be any of their business. It’s not like there will be any guilt-by-association occurring with BYU’s addition to the conference. 
The LDS Church can run BYU in whatever fashion it sees fit, and students have to sign the Honor Code before they step on campus. So it’s not like BYU is hiding anything from incoming students. Their cards are on the table. 
For what it’s worth, the ISU student government president Cole Staudt is against the resolution. He posted this statement to Twitter after it passed. In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0 
— ISU StuGov President (@ISUStuGovPres) September 8, 2016 
Staudt also said, according to the Iowa State Daily , “You make change by embracing people… This resolution is not the way you make change. We don’t make change by excluding people.” 
The ISU student government’s position isn’t anything new for BYU. A few weeks ago 25 LGBT groups wrote to the Big 12 lobbying against BYU’s inclusion, with Athlete Ally later admitting they had not tried to contact the university. Does it matter? 
So what does it all mean? Do these sentiments mean anything to the Big 12 as it continues to search for two schools? 
Probably not. 
First of all, it’s not like these issues are just being discovered by the Big 12. These are topics that have likely been discussed for weeks now with Tom Holmoe and other university administration. The Big 12 knows where BYU truly stands in all this and what they’d like to do moving forward. 
Secondly, the Big 12 is interested in one thing more than anything else – money. And if there’s one thing the Cougars can bring to the Big 12 it’s cash. BYU has been surviving on no football conference payout since going Independent, so any payout from the Big 12 is a massive upgrade. Would the Cougars work out a deal to take, say, 20 percent of their payout for a few years? I’m not sure I have the answer to that, but I know it’s certainly in play. 
Beyond conference payouts, the Cougars bring a stability that no other school offers. The LDS Church provides the school with a national, passionate fan base. Cougar fans will sell out LaVell Edwards Stadium, but they’ll also sell out a women’s volleyball match on a Thursday night. That’s a revenue generator that only BYU can bring. 
The Cougars also have television networks on their side. ESPN getting involved is good for them, because networks have the lion’s share of leverage at this point. There’s big money involved in airing games nationally, and I don’t think ESPN is interested in showing Air Force games in primetime on a Saturday (nothing against the Falcons).

For the Reporter
The BECU Foundation has awarded $3,000 college scholarships to Kent's Maria Namuddu and Sydney Walker.
They're among 80 students to receive the award. Scholarship recipients were chosen based on their academic performance and passion for helping others, through volunteering. Since 1995, the BECU Foundation has awarded more than $2.2 million in scholarships to 950 student members.
Namuddu, a Washington State University student studying nursing, volunteered at a food drive at the Salvation Army in Renton where she sorted out donated food.
""When I was in Africa we had a problem of hunger. Knowing what it means to go without food, this inspired me to volunteer in the hunger food drive at the Salvation Army in Renton,"" she said. ""From this service I learned that hunger is an issue around the world and it is up to us to help those in need. Together as one we can overcome the hunger problem and make the world a better place to live.""
Walker, a Brigham Young University student studying communications, served in Arizona as a missionary, reaching out to others by comforting them and proselytizing.
""I realized that people are more alike than they are different. Service and love can overcome any supposed difference we might think we have with others,"" Walker said. ""I talked with people who had struggled with depression and suicide, lost loved ones and lost jobs. People are resilient. People are strong. People can find joy in any circumstance. In watching people overcome these challenges and devastating moments, I too found joy. Joy came to me, as I derived my purpose from putting other people's challenges above my own.""
Elsewhere
Kent's Emily Church, Shaun Fisher, Katlin Martin and Sarah Zeitler have been named to the Whitworth University Provost's honor roll for spring semester. ... Kent's Jonathan Gildart graduated with honors (cum laude) from Adams State University (Alamosa, Colo.) with a degree in business administration. ... The Kentlake PTSA Class of 2017 is partnering with Clothes for the Cause, a fundraising company that collects clothes in exchange for cash, to raise money for Grad Night Party. Donations can be dropped off at the Safeway parking lot, at 17501 se 272nd St., Covington, on Saturday and Sunday, from 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. For more information, contact coordinator Cindy Spencer at 425-922-2493, Facebook at Clothes for the Cause, Twitter @Clothes4_Cause, Instagram Clothes4_Cause or online at clothesforthecausefundraising.com .

Book Blast w/Giveaway - Slave Queen by HB Moore Slave Queen by H. B. Moore Special Agent Omar Zagouri’s latest case is his most dangerous—and his most personal yet. The discovery of secret sixteenth-century letters unveils a plot between the sultan Suleyman and his chief wife, Roxelane, to change the course of the Ottoman Empire. A descendent of Roxelane, Zagouri learns he has an enemy whose revenge has been centuries in the making. Targeted by an antiquities collector who’s also descended from a chief rival for the ancient throne, Zagouri soon uncovers a modern-day conspiracy that threatens the lives of his family and the security of a nation. To expose the plot, Zagouri must team up with Naim, the son of his nemesis, who heads an international black-market operation that may have ties to the killings. From ancient Constantinople to the present-day Middle East, Zagouri is on a collision course with history. Time is running out to solve a royal mystery and stop a ruthless killer—one who has Zagouri’s name on his hit list. Excerpt: Chapter One Al Karak, Jordan Rashed Sayid picked up his cell phone and selected his most trustworthy contact. The phone call would take only moments, but the result would teach the entire Sayid tribe what honor meant. He shut his third-floor office window, blocking out the rising heat of the Jordanian desert’s summer morning. He and his only brother owned the bank in the city of Al Karak, having started the bank three decades before, and now they were among the wealthiest in town.“Yes?” Yamil answered. “We have proof,” Rashed said into the phone.“Four male witnesses?” Yamil asked. Rashed blew out a breath. Yamil was a stickler for rules. An execution couldn’t be ordered unless there were four respected male witnesses to the crime. There were actually no witnesses, but Rashed knew his daughter was guilty. He had plenty of video footage of her leaving her university apartment more than once after midnight, and he also had other, less legal evidence. There was only one reason for his daughter’s midnight forays. Worst case scenario, Aamira was no longer a virgin. Next case scenario, she’d been tainted in some way by having a relationship with a man other than her fiancé. Rashed was still working on trying to find out whom she was meeting. But it was time to put the execution order into motion. Praise for Slave Queen: ""Moore does an excellent job of setting the scene of international intrigue, and although this novel is part of a series, it also works well as a stand-alone. The story jumps back and forth between the present and the past as Moore tells the story of Roxelane's capture by the Turkish army and her subsequent love affair with Suleiman. Roxelane is an excellent, strong female character, and Moore brings some obscure players from the Ottoman Empire vividly to life. She even quotes from Suleiman's actual poetry . . . to conjure a complex portrait of this larger-than-life figure. A satisfying historical thriller."" --Kirkus Reviews ""From sultans and hierarchies that separate men and women from Poland to Constantinople and beyond to new lives in great cities where mosques and sultans rule, these vivid past and present scenarios contribute to a story fueled by cultural revelations and the long-standing threat a series of letters reveals. The result is a fast-paced, complex, and absorbing adventure saga that crosses time and place to give Omar, Mia (and readers) a run for their money. Warning: once begun, it's nearly impossible to put down the full-flavored, multi-faceted Slave Queen, which reveals many insights about the Ottoman Empire, Süleyman the Magnificent, and the slave girl foreigner who turned out to be his favorite wife."" --D.

#ColinKaepernickSyllabus | New Black Man in Exile
On September 4, Rebecca Martinez tweeted Louis Moore and David J. Leonard, suggesting the creation of Colin Kaepernick Syllabus. Soon, we, along with  Bijan C. Bayne, Sarah J. Jackson, and many others began the work of creating a syllabus to hopefully elevate and empower the conversations that Colin Kaepernick started when he decided to sit down in protest during an August 26, 2016 preseason game.  
Building on the framework established by Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha Blain, with their monumental #CharlestonSyllabus, Marcia Chatelain with #FergusonSyllabus and subsequent efforts from Candice Benbow with #LemonadeSyllabus and others who have sought to not only use social media and online technology to crowdsource and aggregate conversations, this syllabus represents an effort to bring  together multiple conversations, histories, disciplines, discourses, and spaces.  If we are going to follow Colin Kaepernick’s lead to have conversations and work toward justice, we must do so with the necessary tools and collective understanding.  This requires engaging multiple conversations, entering into these spaces with a historic foundation, with knowledge about the persistent realities of racial injustice and inequality, with insight into the longstanding struggles of the Black athlete.  This syllabus represents an attempt to aid in these conversations, to turn our everyday conversations, debates, and discourse into a classroom, all while making sure our institutionalized classrooms are engaged with the histories, struggles, and public discourses that shape our current moment.  
Harry Edwards recently recently wrote, “silence is evil’s greatest and most consistently dependable ally.” For all those engaged in these conversations, for those who have written, spoke about, and organized around racial injustice, silence is antithetical to our work, our ethos.  Yet, too often people speak past one another; too many people presume because of the everyday saturation of sports culture, the ubiquity of media coverage of the Colin Kaepernick, and the hypervisibility (and invisibility) of racial discourse, along with the belief that this is all about opinions and “two sides” that they are prepared for these important conversations.   
Too often, especially within the media and from those whose whiteness - their privilege - insulates, empowers, and protects, people speak without the requisite tools, without the requisite historic foundation, and without necessary information. This offers a toolbox of knowledge, links to resources, and information. The #Kaepernick syllabus furthers the efforts to disrupt the silence, to make connections, and to otherwise build on the work of Kaepernick, Edwards, members of the WNBA, Bomani Jones, Serena Williams, and so many others demanding that we speak and act.  While continuing the conversation is important, it must be done so with literacy and knowledge about American racism, the history of sports, the African American athlete, #BLM, protests, and so much more.  Discussions aren’t inherently transformative but with the requisite understanding, introspection about privilege and widely-held assumptions, and critical examination, we are better equipped as we walk toward justice and radical transformation #KapernickSyllabus #WeSitWithKaep

Salt Lake Tribune partially wins appeal over records sought in its BYU assault investigation By COURTNEY TANNER   31   4 minutes ago Share   (1) The Salt Lake Tribune won, in part, an appeal to the State Records Committee on Thursday, requiring the Provo and Orem police departments to provide a report showing any instances of when Brigham Young University officers accessed the two agencies' records through a shared countywide database. Jessica Miller, a Tribune reporter, filed the appeal in July after the two agencies denied her initial requests, filed May 25. The records would contribute to the newspaper's investigation of students who say they were targeted by BYU's Honor Code Office after reporting sexual assaults. The Tribune previously obtained documents showing that one BYU police lieutenant accessed a Provo police record, purportedly so he could collect information for an Honor Code investigation into a female student who filed a rape case . He read the report by using the countywide database shared by 22 law enforcement agencies in Utah County, including Provo, Orem and BYU police. VIDEOS TOP JOBS Because BYU, which is owned by The   Saints, is a private institution, it is not subject to records requests. The university has repeatedly stressed that the police department and Honor Code Office — which oversees the school's ban on alcohol, premarital sex and other conduct-based regulations — are separate. The case logs, though, register details on the time, date and user who accesses a report, as well as what the user does with the document: view, print or amend. Each user is identified first by a two-digit code for his or her agency and then by name. The State Records Committee unanimously voted Thursday to require Orem and Provo police to compile for The Tribune a report listing when a BYU user accessed an Orem or Provo record on the database — redacting the user ID and details about the case, such as names of suspects or victims. Attorneys representing Provo and Orem police initially requested that the appeal be dismissed Thursday for filing errors made by The Tribune, but the committee denied the request. During the hearing, Camille Williams, representing Provo police, said the two law enforcement agencies would have to create a database report that ""does not exist as a record,"" so the request should be denied. Williams also said it would be impossible to produce the report. Chris Black, a systems administrator for the database, testified for the police agencies, saying there's no feasible way to compile the data into a report without a third-party software, which some of the agencies don't have. The police agencies also argued that releasing the data would interfere with two Utah Department of Public Safety (DPS) investigations examining potential BYU violations related to access of the sexual assault reports, said Kevin Bolander, of the Utah attorney general's office. According to Utah's Government Records Access and Management Act, or GRAMA, any public employee who has lawful access to protected records and improperly shares that information could be charged with class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. Bolander has reviewed records from the database logs during the investigation, he said, and worries about potentially classified and ""sensitive information"" being made public. The committee, however, said if Bolander and others working on the DPS investigation have access to reports generated from the case logs, it would be possible to compile the data in accordance with The Tribune's request. ""If they pulled it for [Bolander] to look at it,"" said committee member David Fleming, ""they can pull it for The Tribune and redact portions."" Though blocking out the usernames will limit investigations into whether certain BYU police officers consistently view external reports more than others, Miller gladly accepted the proposed redactions over a ""blanket denial."" As part of her appeal, Miller said she requested the records before they were classified as ""protected"" on May 26, when the investigation began at the request of BYU and Provo police. Additionally, she argued, divulging the frequency of BYU's database access doesn't ""reasonably"" interfere with the investigation. The attorney representing Orem, Heather Schriever, disagreed, saying it's ""unclear"" who owns the rights to the data — the police groups or Spillman, the company that provides the database — meaning it may not be in the two agencies' jurisdiction to release the information. Committee members rejected the argument, noting that until ownership is determined, the law enforcement agencies must produce the request because their records comprise the case-log database. The committee partially granted Miller's request, requiring Orem and Provo police to produce a database report covering the past 18 months — the agencies delete any older data periodically to save space on servers, Black said. Miller originally requested records of BYU police officers' viewing of the case logs from January 2010 to present. The report would also include any instance of a BYU user viewing a case — rather than solely sexual assault cases — because the database doesn't allow records to be sorted by type.

myhighplains.com,9/9/2016 4:47,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Question 
I’m having a serious struggle with my now ex-fiancé. I broke up with him because of a long series of trust issues and eventually learning that he was unfaithful to me throughout our relationship. He claims that these relationships never progressed beyond flirting, including one of his previous ex-girlfriends. He kept secret accounts and even a phone to hide his exploits. 
This has destroyed the world I built with him and I’m the one left picking up the pieces. It’s been over a month since I broke things off with him and I’m still trying to figure out where I stand in life, even with him. I know that it’s stupid, but I still love him. I know I shouldn’t be dating him and I know I can’t trust him, but even with time away and focusing on other things and people, he’s the only person I want to be with. 
I feel he’s already moved on. He talks to other women and has admitted to liking them, though he claims to just be friends. However he keeps assuring me he wants to work things out with me. I agreed to waiting six months and then see how we feel about each other. 
Am I stupid for holding out any hope for him or us? I feel like I must be. I know most people would have dropped him like a rock for that betrayal of trust, but I love him so much and am very forgiving. I’ve asked him to seek counseling (for himself) and I don’t know if he’ll do it or not. I’ve also suggested couple’s therapy, but he didn’t seem to care for the idea. I’ve seen little things he’s putting effort into to be a better person, but I don’t want to kid myself into thinking he’ll change for me. 
Is it worth my time to wait for him? Should I even bother giving him a chance to be in my life? 
Answer 
Anytime someone we trusted dupes us, we feel stupid. It’s an awful feeling to realize that he could hide his unfaithful behavior in plain sight. Just because you didn’t see it at the time doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. Some people are that good at hiding their behavior. 
However, now that you see it, you have to do something about it. Please don’t spend all of your time beating yourself up for not seeing the truth. If you continue to blame yourself, you’ll be placing the accountability on the wrong person. He is the one who needs to be accountable for not only being unfaithful to you, but also manipulating you with his lies. 
This is not a safe relationship. He’s not someone who made one mistake and is working to repair it. He is living a pattern of infidelity and secrecy that makes him a terrible option for a lifetime of security and safety. Be grateful that you are seeing this pattern now. 
Elder Jeffrey R. Holland made it clear that when we are dating, we need to carefully evaluate the safety of the relationship. He said, “Life is tough enough without having the person who is supposed to love you leading the assault on your self-esteem, your sense of dignity, your confidence, and your joy. In this person’s care you deserve to feel physically safe and emotionally secure.” [i] Your future with this guy in his current state would leave you feeling physically unsafe and emotionally insecure. 
That brings up the question of whether or not he can change. Yes, he can change. However, there are some conditions that make lasting change possible. Elder Russell M. Nelson explains: “We can change our behavior. Our very desires can change. How? There is only one way. True change—permanent change—can come only through the healing, cleansing, and enabling power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He loves you—each of you! He allows you to access His power as you keep His commandments, eagerly, earnestly, and exactly. It is that simple and certain. The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of change!” [ii] 
Notice that the conditions for lasting change include eager, earnest, and exact obedience. The only thing your ex-fiancé is consistently doing is making excuses for his behavior. He’s not willing to go to individual or couples counseling. He’s not stopping his behavior. He’s telling you things you want to hear, but continuing to act in ways that betray your confidence. 
He isn’t doing anything to actually repair the damage he’s caused. He’s left you with no comfort or reassurance that he wants to be with you. His puny efforts don’t even begin to offer healing to the gaping wounds he’s created. President Spencer W. Kimball declared, “When dealing with transgression, apply a bandage large enough to cover the wound—no larger, no smaller.” [iii] If he’s going to be a safe partner for you, he has to make dramatic efforts to heal this relationship. It sounds like he’s moved on and left you to heal on your own. 
Your love for him is real because you were real in your love. He was not real with you. He had secrets and didn’t give you everything. When you give all of yourself to someone, you experience true love. You are not married to him. You don’t have children with him. The only thing you owe him is an authentic reaction to his infidelity. You are better off finding someone who wants to reciprocate your willingness to give all to this relationship.

“Behold, I, Samuel, a Lamanite, do speak the words of the Lord which he doth put into my heart; and behold he hath put it into my heart to say unto this people that the sword of justice hangeth over this people; and four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people. Helaman 13:5 
The Know 
During his extended address to the Nephites in Zarahemla, Samuel the Lamanite made two remarkably specific prophetic utterances. First, he declared, “four hundred years pass not away save the sword of justice falleth upon this people” ( Helaman 13:5 ; cf. v. 9 ; Alma 45:10 ). Later, he said, “Behold, I give unto you a sign; for five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all those who shall believe on his name” ( Helaman 14:2 ). 
Such precise prophetic predictions are rare in scripture. [1] Even within Samuel’s own discourse, there is another prophecy—the sign of Christ’s death—where the exact timing is not mentioned (see Helaman 14:14, 20–27 ). [2] It seems likely that when the exact timing is included in the record, the timing itself was somehow significant. 
All ancient societies had important calendar units or time periods that were carefully marked. [3] LDS Mesoamericanist John E. Clark noted, “The major cycle of Maya time was a four-hundred-year period called a baktun .” [4] Each baktun was broken down into 20 units called a katun , a 20-year cycle, and the katun was subdivided into units called a hotun , which was a five-year cycle. [5] According to John L. Sorenson, “Omens and prophecies … among the Maya were commonly phrased in terms of the beginning or ending of whole calendar units.” [6] 
In this light, it is significant that both of Samuel the Lamanite’s time-specific prophecies correlate to the specific units of measurement within the Mesoamerican calendrical system. [7] As Clark put it, “Samuel the Lamanite warned the Nephites that one baktun ‘shall not pass away before … they [would] be smitten’ ( Helaman 13:9 ).” [8] 
Another LDS Mesoamericanist, Mark Wright, suggested, “Samuel the Lamanite may have been making a hotun prophecy when he stated that in ‘five years’ signs would be given concerning the birth of Christ ( Helaman 14:2 ).” [9] Interestingly, according to Sorenson, “In Yucatan at the time of the Spanish conquest, the ruler or his spokesman … had the duty to prophesy five years in advance what fate the next twenty-year katun would bring.” [10] In similar fashion, Samuel the Lamanite prophesied the fate of the next baktun ( Helaman 13:5, 9 ), and apparently did so five years in advance ( Helaman 14:2 ). [11] 
The Why 
Mesoamerican anthropologist Prudence M. Rice explained, “Time is a cultural construct. Its units of measurement, meaning, and so on are unique in terms of legitimizing power and authority.” [12] It is therefore highly significant that Samuel the Lamanite’s chronologically precise prophecies each used time periods that were likely important within the broader cultural context of the Nephites. The use of these culturally important time periods likely served to legitimize Samuel’s prophetic authority and credibility. 
As Sorenson observed, “In Mesoamerican thinking, Alma’s and Samuel’s prophecies for an entire baktun would have been exceedingly profound statements.” [13] Another Latter-day Saint Mesoamerican expert agreed: “Samuel’s prophecy included such a powerfully evocative number that the people would doubtless have considered the entire prophecy highly symbolic.” [14] 
According to Wright, [15] part of that symbolism would have made the prophetic utterance relevant for Samuel’s contemporary Nephite audience. Mesoamerican views of time were cyclical—meaning they expected certain events to repeat themselves over the course of each katun or baktun . [16] 
Thus, a prophecy of destruction in 400 years—in one baktun —could also be considered a warning of destruction in the here and now. [17] Indeed, Samuel warned that at that very moment, “the sword of justice hangeth over this people,” that “the anger of the Lord is already kindled against you,” and that the only way out was repentance followed by continuing faith in Jesus Christ ( Helaman 13:5–6, 30 ). [18] 
Meanwhile, the hotun was a period commonly celebrated and commemorated, as was the katun . [19] Samuel’s prophecy warned the people in advanced that the next hotun would truly be a cause to celebrate—it would mark the birth of the Lord and Savior into the world. Mormon recorded that the coming of the sign did indeed bring “glad tidings unto the people” ( 3 Nephi 1:26 ). The occasion was no doubt honored and celebrated for hotuns and katuns to come, not only as marking the birth of Christ but also in commemoration of the miraculous timing of the sign—coming, as it did, just in time to spare the believers from being executed ( 3 Nephi 1:8–16 ). 
This background also potentially explains why a specific time frame for the sign of Christ’s death goes unmentioned in Samuel’s prophecy. It did not come at the completion of an important unit of time, as did the birth of Christ (a hotun ) and the ultimate fall of the Nephites (a baktun ). Mormon, it seems, mentioned the specific time frame of these events when it coincided with time cycles deemed important within the surrounding culture. The prophetic use of highly symbolic time periods in Book of Mormon prophecy appears to be an example of the Lord speaking “unto men according to their language, unto their understanding” ( 2 Nephi 31:3 ; cf. Doctrine and Covenants 1:24 ). [20]

[1] The only other example in the Book of Mormon, also involving the timing of Christ’s birth, is Lehi’s and Nephi’s 600-year prophecy (see 1 Nephi 10:3 ; 19:8 ; 2 Nephi 25:19 ). Samuel’s five-year prophecy was particularly unique. Brant A. Gardner, Second Witness: Analytical and Contextual Commentary on the Book of Mormon , 6 vols. (Salt Lake City, UT: Greg Kofford Books, 2007), 5:190: “The specificity of this prophecy is unique in the scriptural canon. Other time-specific prophecies (e.g., that the Messiah would be born six hundred years from Lehi’s departure from Jerusalem, and that the Nephites would be destroyed in four hundred years) were uttered about a future so distant that no listener would still be alive. Because six hundred and four hundred are round numbers, they also might be understood by the listeners as generic rather than specific figures. … The five-year prophecy, however, is absolute, finite, and testable within the lifetime of virtually all of Samuel’s listeners.” 
[2] While Samuel’s prophecy in Helaman 14 never mentions the timing of the sign of Christ’s death, it is evident from 3 Nephi 8:1–4 that the timing had been revealed to the Nephites at some point. Whether it was Samuel who revealed the timing or someone else is not clear, as it only says that the people “began to look with great earnestness for the sign which had been given by the prophet Samuel” ( v. 3 ). Only the sign, not the timing, is connected to Samuel. Perhaps the timing was revealed by the “just man” who kept the record and “did many miracles in the name of Jesus” ( v. 1 ). It could also have been revealed in some of the “much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them” in the wake of the first sign ( 3 Nephi 2:10 ). If it was Samuel, it would appear that Mormon omitted that detail when he copied over Samuel’s prophecies, perhaps for the reasons suggested here: the timing did not coincide with a number full of symbolic significance.

Thompson (Salt Lake City and Orem, UT: Eborn Books and Interpreter Foundation, 2014), 253: “The twenty-year katun was subdivided into five-year periods called hotuns , which were often celebrated by royalty and commemorated in monumental inscriptions.” Also see Prudence M.

M.-Charlotte Arnauld and Alain Breton (Mesoweb Press, 2013), 13: “The completion of full twenty-year k’atun or their five-year quarters were regularly celebrated by rulers in what Mayanists call ‘Period-Ending’ (hereafter PE) ceremonies.”

[7] It is important to note that the Nephites need not be using the Mayan calendar to nonetheless recognize the sacred importance of these numbers in the calendaring of their neighbors, and to even be influenced in such a way to as also give weight and import to time cycles of 5, 20, and 400 years themselves. Though commonly referred to as the “Maya” calendar system, it was known throughout Mesoamerica and likely had its origins among the Olmec between 500–400 BC. The earliest long count date attested is 36 BC, on Stela 2 in Chiapa de Corzo, confirming it’s use in Samuel’s time. See Gardner, Second Witness , 5:177; Foster, Handbook to Life , 36–37. Interestingly, Chiapa de Corzo is in Chiapas, Mexico in the Grijalva River valley, believed by some scholars to be the land of Zarahemla. Chiapa de Corzo is even identified by some scholars as the Nephite city of Sidom. See John L. Sorenson, An Ancient American Setting for the Book of Mormon (Salt Lake City and Provo, UT: Deseret Book and FARMS, 1985), 5–38, 148–167, 197, 204–206; Joseph L. Allen and Blake L.

Also, Clark, “ Archaeological Trends ,” 90: “The Book of Mormon records several references to a significant four-hundred-year prophecy, consistent with this idiosyncratic Mesoamerican calendar practice.” In addition to Helaman 13:5, 9 , see Alma 45:10 ; Mormon 8:6 ; Moroni 10:1 .

[11] The 400-year prophecy appears to have been understood and interpreted as 400 years from the birth of Christ ( Mormon 8:6–7 ). Alma 45:10 says “the Nephites … in four hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ shall manifest himself unto them, shall dwindle in unbelief.” 
[13] Sorenson, Ancient American Setting , 274. 
[14] Gardner, Second Witness , 5:177. 
[15] Personal communication to Book of Mormon Central staff. 
[16] Sorenson, Mormon’s Codex , 439; Rice, “ Time, Memory, and Resilience ,” 13, 16: “For the Maya, time was simultaneously linear and cyclical, an endless—‘timeless’—rotation of k’atun, b’ak’tun, and multiple eras of creation (as in the Popol Vuh).” Spencer-Ahrens and Wren, “Arithmetic, Astronomy, and the Calendar,” 247: “The cycles dominated Maya thought and resulted in a deterministic view in which history repeated itself. If a given day or period resulted in dreadful consequences once, it would do so again when the day returned or when the cycle repeated itself.” Just as with the important numbers themselves (5, 20, and 400 year cycles), the Nephites need not be using the Maya calendar itself in order to have enculturated views of time as cyclical. 
[17] Spencer-Ahrens and Wren, “Arithmetic, Astronomy, and the Calendar,” 257, noted, “each k’atun expressed a prophecy of the future while at the same time embodying the historical past.” Samuel seems to be expressing the same concept, only using a baktun rather than a katun . 
[18] Evidence for these notions of cyclical time may be evident in the Book of Mormon. For instance, notice that 20 years (one katun ) after Samuel said “the sword of justice hangeth over this people” ( Helaman 13:5 ), Mormon reported that “the sword of destruction did hang over” the Nephites once again ( 3 Nephi 2:19 ). 
[19] Wright, “ Nephite Daykeepers ,” 253; Rice, “ Time, Memory, and Resilience ,” 13. Again, for Nephites influenced by the surrounding culture, 5, 20, or 400 year periods can be deemed important, celebratory occasions without necessarily adopting the Maya calendar.

LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION, SHALL WE? 
COMPLETELY TESTED!!!
 ~ON 8/2/2016 (CLEAN AND CLEAR). So, have you ever got yourself tested at all???
The only one girl with “The best magic” of All…
‘The one & only cleanest , healthiest than yo’momma, yo’ wife , yo’ gf and you, combined….”
I GOT TESTED (BLOOD & URINE) & SWAB FOR MOUTH, ASS, WITH ALL COMPLETE ADVANCE LAB TEST, FOR ALL STDs/ HIV, Hep C etc (CLEAN AND CLEAR).
AND I’M ON PrEP ~ ( Meaning: Stds free and hiv free and no hepatitis A, B & C. And you can only be on PrEP if you have been completely tested, STDs FREE, NO health issues whatsoever (esp. liver, kidney & bones) and PrEP can only be prescribed by your doctor. If you’re HIV positive, you can’t be on PrEP (too little too late, the ship has sailed- And Oh Danny boy starts to play Uh Oh..). 
AND GET VACCINATED FOR:
1.PNEUMOCOCCAL 23-VALENT,
2.HPV (get the gardasil9 - New HPV Vaccine)
3.TDAP,
4.MENINGOCOCCAL
5. PLUS, IMMUNE OF HEPATITIS A/B TOO..
6. GOT MY COLONOSCOPY & COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS ETC..
DO YOU KNOW? VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. WELL, NOW YO DO…
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT ??
“THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE , THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD TO BANG, FIRST OF ALL, ON PrEP AND EARLY VACCINATIONS, AT LEAST  FOR EARLY HPV & HEPATITIS  (All 3 doses). There’s a newest HPV vaccine, gardasil9.
Three types of pathogens of concern, are Hepatitis , Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is much more contagious than HIV.  While HPV is the easiest and most common one, transmitted among people who are late to get the vaccines or never have the vaccines.There’s no cure for HPV & Condom do not protect you against Hepatitis & HPV at all, but Only early vaccinations do. Most of the guys, girls, gays, ts and bi, (you see or have been with), have either one or both or three of those pathogens. If they never get their early vaccinations or they’re late or never get tested for HIV (and/or NOT on PrEP). A Lot of people don’t even know what they have or not aware of them.
AND THE MORE POPULAR A GIRL OR GUY, THE MORE “ADMIRERS” THEY HAVE.  AS A RESULT OF LOTS OF “ADMIRERS” A.K.A “SEX”, THE MORE VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS THAT THEY HAVE. JUST PICTURE EACH GUY CHIPS IN WITH THEIR OWN STRAIN OF VIRUSES (HPV, HEP, OR POSSIBLY “HIV” TOO). SO, COUNT HOW MANY GUYS? 1? 10? 100?,  LET’S SAY “HPV”. DO YOU KNOW 14 MILLIONS NEW PEOPLE GET INFECTED BY HPV IN THE U.S EVERY YEAR (PER CDC). (AND THEY COULD BE YOUR TRICKS, HOOK UP FRIENDS, GIRLS/BOYS, GAYS, ESCORTS, SOMEONE’S HUSBAND/ WIFE ETC.)  (VICIOUS CYCLE - AND KEEP ON MULTIPLYING…) 👀🙃
AND OF COURSE, IF THEY NEVER HAVE EARLY VACCINATIONS OR IF THEY’RE LATE, OR WORSE IF THEY NEVER GOT VACCINATED AT ALL. THEY ALL BECOME “THE HOSTS” A.K.A “DEADLY CARRIERS”. SOOO, EXCUSE ME…. WHEN DID YOU SAY YOU GOT YOURSELF VACCINATED AGAIN? 😄👀 
BUT IF YOU GOT VACCINATED  (HPV, HEPATITIS ETC) SINCE YOU’RE 13 - 15 LIKE ME, YOU’RE GOOD. WELL, YOU’RE JUST MMM SLUTTY, THE BIGGEST SLUT OF ALL, AREN’T YOU???  YES YOU ARE..😄 
AND AGAIN, ANYONE CAN SAY THEY HAD OR HAVE BEEN VACCINATED OR ON PrEP , BUT NO PROOF A.K.A “BLOWING SMOKE”. DON’T GET FOOLED.  IT’S A TREND MANY GIRLS OR GUYS USE NOWADAYS. ( TELL THEM TO SHOW YOU THE BOTTLES OF PREP (TRUVADA) THEY HAVE TAKEN, PRESCRIBED ON THEIR NAMES? ~ (WELL, WELL, WELL,  LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN, A PINOCCHIOOO…) 😉
IF YOU’RE ON PrEP, THAT’S VERY GOOD.  BUT IF YOU DON’T GET VACCINATED FOR HPV & HEPATITIS. YOUR PROTECTION IS NOT COMPLETE. HPV & HEPATITIS ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEM (teenagers, girls, boys, men, women, gay, bi, straight -everyone really without early vaccinations) - (The main cause of CERVICAL CANCER, ANAL CANCER, COCK, BALLS, MOUTH, THROAT CANCER, LIVER CYST, LIVER CIRRHOSIS, LIVER CANCER ETC). MANY HAVE HPV & HEPATITIS AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM, AND AGAIN HIV TOO.
PLUS MEN CAN BE CARRIERS OF THESE HPV VIRUSES (OF ANY TYPES). As CDC states, “Many men who get HPV(of any types) might not develop symptoms and the infection for a while (It’s like a ticking bomb), and become “the carriers”, spreading around everywhere (their spouse, partners, hook-ups/tricks, girls, boys, gays, escorts, massage parlors etc). However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, colons, Vagina, vulva, cervix,  mouth, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)”.
“CONDOMS DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM HPV VIRUSES & HEPATITIS A,B & C, ONLY EARLY VACCINES DO”. IF YOU’RE LATE TO GET THE HPV VACCINES, YOU’RE LATE TO THOSE HPV VIRUSES, YOU HAVE GOT. ONCE YOU GET THE HPV (OF ANY TYPES), IT STAYS, IN YOU FOREVER. AND CONDOMS CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU FROM HIV UP TO 70%, WITH 30% RISK. NEW MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH TO PEVENT HIV IS  “PrEP”.
According to CDC, Vaccine-preventable diseases cause long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death.Did You Know that?
Each year In the United States:1. Each year, an average of 226,000 people are hospitalized due to influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die of influenza and its complications, the majority are among adults.2. There were approximately 32,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2012. Of those cases, there were about 3,300 deaths.3. 800,000 to 1.4 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, with complications such as liver cancer.4. In the U.S., HPV causes about 17,000 cancers in women, and about 9,000 cancers in men each year. About 10,000 die each year from HPV related cancers.
5. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 50 men will receive a diagnosis of HIV infection at some point in their lifetimes. Over the course of their lifetimes, 1 in 15 black men/women will be diagnosed with HIV infection, as will 1 in 18 Hispanic/ Latino men/women, 1 in 25 white men/women, 1 in 30  Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander men/women,  1 in 50 American Indian/Alaska Native men/women. 
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT?? 
Did you ever kiss, lick, touch, suck, drink, sex (vagina, ass, oral), with other girl, guy, ts, escorts or anyone who do not get their early vaccinations and/or on PrEP ? If you did or do, you just have to. 
Only complete advance lab test (blood, urine & swabs) will let you know for sure. It’s better to know your body & health than Not. Only a fool ignores his own body or health. No matter whom you’re with (gf, bf, hook-ups, someone’s gf, bf, wife, husband, tricks,1 nightstand, college friends, gay, bi, straight, escorts, porn stars, massage parlors etc), in any intimate event involve with:
 1.Skin touching skin ~HPV (hands, lips, genitals, massages etc), and 
2.Body fluids ~Hep A,B & C (saliva, pre-cum, cum etc), or 
3. Sex, oral or penetration ~ HIV, HPV & Hep ( oral, rim, penetrations, cock, vagina, handjob etc).
AND TO GO ON WITH THE STORY, MMM COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BECOOOOS THEY CAN PREVENT CANCERS. ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

Bianca Britton,9/9/2016 5:10,"(CNN) -- A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX EDUCATION, SHALL WE? 
COMPLETELY TESTED!!!
 ~ON 8/2/2016 (CLEAN AND CLEAR). So, have you ever got yourself tested at all???
The only one girl with “The best magic” of All…
‘The one & only cleanest , healthiest than yo’momma, yo’ wife , yo’ gf and you, combined….”
I GOT TESTED (BLOOD & URINE) & SWAB FOR MOUTH, ASS, WITH ALL COMPLETE ADVANCE LAB TEST, FOR ALL STDs/ HIV, Hep C etc (CLEAN AND CLEAR).
AND I’M ON PrEP ~ ( Meaning: Stds free and hiv free and no hepatitis A, B & C. And you can only be on PrEP if you have been completely tested, STDs FREE, NO health issues whatsoever (esp. liver, kidney & bones) and PrEP can only be prescribed by your doctor. If you’re HIV positive, you can’t be on PrEP (too little too late, the ship has sailed- And Oh Danny boy starts to play Uh Oh..). 
AND GET VACCINATED FOR:
1.PNEUMOCOCCAL 23-VALENT,
2.HPV (get the gardasil9 - New HPV Vaccine)
3.TDAP,
4.MENINGOCOCCAL
5. PLUS, IMMUNE OF HEPATITIS A/B TOO..
6. GOT MY COLONOSCOPY & COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS ETC..
DO YOU KNOW? VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. WELL, NOW YO DO…
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT ??
“THE ONLY WAY TO GUARANTEE , THAT YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD TO BANG, FIRST OF ALL, ON PrEP AND EARLY VACCINATIONS, AT LEAST  FOR EARLY HPV & HEPATITIS  (All 3 doses). There’s a newest HPV vaccine, gardasil9.
Three types of pathogens of concern, are Hepatitis , Human Papilloma Viruses (HPV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Hepatitis B is much more contagious than HIV.  While HPV is the easiest and most common one, transmitted among people who are late to get the vaccines or never have the vaccines.There’s no cure for HPV & Condom do not protect you against Hepatitis & HPV at all, but Only early vaccinations do. Most of the guys, girls, gays, ts and bi, (you see or have been with), have either one or both or three of those pathogens. If they never get their early vaccinations or they’re late or never get tested for HIV (and/or NOT on PrEP). A Lot of people don’t even know what they have or not aware of them.
AND THE MORE POPULAR A GIRL OR GUY, THE MORE “ADMIRERS” THEY HAVE.  AS A RESULT OF LOTS OF “ADMIRERS” A.K.A “SEX”, THE MORE VIRUSES AND PATHOGENS THAT THEY HAVE. JUST PICTURE EACH GUY CHIPS IN WITH THEIR OWN STRAIN OF VIRUSES (HPV, HEP, OR POSSIBLY “HIV” TOO). SO, COUNT HOW MANY GUYS? 1? 10? 100?,  LET’S SAY “HPV”. DO YOU KNOW 14 MILLIONS NEW PEOPLE GET INFECTED BY HPV IN THE U.S EVERY YEAR (PER CDC). (AND THEY COULD BE YOUR TRICKS, HOOK UP FRIENDS, GIRLS/BOYS, GAYS, ESCORTS, SOMEONE’S HUSBAND/ WIFE ETC.)  (VICIOUS CYCLE - AND KEEP ON MULTIPLYING…) 👀🙃
AND OF COURSE, IF THEY NEVER HAVE EARLY VACCINATIONS OR IF THEY’RE LATE, OR WORSE IF THEY NEVER GOT VACCINATED AT ALL. THEY ALL BECOME “THE HOSTS” A.K.A “DEADLY CARRIERS”. SOOO, EXCUSE ME…. WHEN DID YOU SAY YOU GOT YOURSELF VACCINATED AGAIN? 😄👀 (* THE ANSWER MY FRIEND, IS BLOWING IN THE WIND. THE ANSWER IS BLOWING IN THE WIND…)👈😉
BUT IF YOU GOT VACCINATED  (HPV, HEPATITIS ETC) SINCE YOU’RE 13 - 15 LIKE ME, YOU’RE GOOD. WELL, YOU’RE JUST MMM SLUTTY, THE BIGGEST SLUT OF ALL, AREN’T YOU???  YES YOU ARE..😄 
AND AGAIN, ANYONE CAN SAY THEY HAD OR HAVE BEEN VACCINATED OR ON PrEP , BUT NO PROOF A.K.A “BLOWING SMOKE”. DON’T GET FOOLED.  IT’S A TREND MANY GIRLS OR GUYS USE NOWADAYS. ( TELL THEM TO SHOW YOU THE BOTTLES OF PREP (TRUVADA) THEY HAVE TAKEN, PRESCRIBED ON THEIR NAMES? ~ (WELL, WELL, WELL,  LOOK WHAT THE CAT DRAGGED IN, A PINOCCHIOOO…) 😉
IF YOU’RE ON PrEP, THAT’S VERY GOOD.  BUT IF YOU DON’T GET VACCINATED FOR HPV & HEPATITIS. YOUR PROTECTION IS NOT COMPLETE. HPV & HEPATITIS ARE MORE CONTAGIOUS AND A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE THEM (teenagers, girls, boys, men, women, gay, bi, straight -everyone really without early vaccinations) - (The main cause of CERVICAL CANCER, ANAL CANCER, COCK, BALLS, MOUTH, THROAT CANCER, LIVER CYST, LIVER CIRRHOSIS, LIVER CANCER ETC). MANY HAVE HPV & HEPATITIS AND THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF THEM, AND AGAIN HIV TOO.
PLUS MEN CAN BE CARRIERS OF THESE HPV VIRUSES (OF ANY TYPES). As CDC states, “Many men who get HPV(of any types) might not develop symptoms and the infection for a while (It’s like a ticking bomb), and become “the carriers”, spreading around everywhere (their spouse, partners, hook-ups/tricks, girls, boys, gays, escorts, massage parlors etc). However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types can cause cancers of the penis, anus, colons, Vagina, vulva, cervix,  mouth, or oropharynx (back of the throat, including base of the tongue and tonsils.)”.
“CONDOMS DO NOT PROTECT YOU FROM HPV VIRUSES & HEPATITIS A,B & C, ONLY EARLY VACCINES DO”. IF YOU’RE LATE TO GET THE HPV VACCINES, YOU’RE LATE TO THOSE HPV VIRUSES, YOU HAVE GOT. ONCE YOU GET THE HPV (OF ANY TYPES), IT STAYS, IN YOU FOREVER. AND CONDOMS CAN ONLY PROTECT YOU FROM HIV UP TO 70%, WITH 30% RISK. NEW MEDICAL BREAKTHROUGH TO PEVENT HIV IS  “PrEP”.
According to CDC, Vaccine-preventable diseases cause long-term illness, hospitalization, and even death.Did You Know that?
Each year In the United States:1. Each year, an average of 226,000 people are hospitalized due to influenza and between 3,000 and 49,000 people die of influenza and its complications, the majority are among adults.2. There were approximately 32,000 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease in 2012. Of those cases, there were about 3,300 deaths.3. 800,000 to 1.4 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B, with complications such as liver cancer.4. In the U.S., HPV causes about 17,000 cancers in women, and about 9,000 cancers in men each year. About 10,000 die each year from HPV related cancers.
5. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 50 men will receive a diagnosis of HIV infection at some point in their lifetimes. Over the course of their lifetimes, 1 in 15 black men/women will be diagnosed with HIV infection, as will 1 in 18 Hispanic/ Latino men/women, 1 in 25 white men/women, 1 in 30  Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander men/women,  1 in 50 American Indian/Alaska Native men/women. 
SOOOO, WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOT SHOT?? 
Did you ever kiss, lick, touch, suck, drink, sex (vagina, ass, oral), with other girl, guy, ts, escorts or anyone who do not get their early vaccinations and/or on PrEP ? If you did or do, you just have to. 
Only complete advance lab test (blood, urine & swabs) will let you know for sure. It’s better to know your body & health than Not. Only a fool ignores his own body or health. No matter whom you’re with (gf, bf, hook-ups, someone’s gf, bf, wife, husband, tricks,1 nightstand, college friends, gay, bi, straight, escorts, porn stars, massage parlors etc), in any intimate event involve with:
 1.Skin touching skin ~HPV (hands, lips, genitals, massages etc), and 
2.Body fluids ~Hep A,B & C (saliva, pre-cum, cum etc), or 
3. Sex, oral or penetration ~ HIV, HPV & Hep ( oral, rim, penetrations, cock, vagina, handjob etc).
AND TO GO ON WITH THE STORY, MMM COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS ARE ALSO VERY IMPORTANT. BECOOOOS THEY CAN PREVENT CANCERS. ESPECIALLY CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL/ANAL CANCER. AND THEY ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
~THAT’S WHY, MR KNOW IT ALL, HAVE IT ALL & DO IT ALL….~👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
CONCLUSIONS: (PAY ATTENTION)  MR. Know it all, have it all & do it all..): 👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
1 in 4 people living with HIV infection in the United States are women. Most new HIV infections are from heterosexual contact (84%) & among Gays, nowadays. By race/ethnicity, black & Hispanic men & women have the highest rates of new HIV infections among all. A lot of these people look normal & healthy, don’t show any symptoms at all. So, you can’t tell from the look, but lab test. And, commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papilloma viruses(HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University. ”
As CDC states:  “ Most often, cervix, vulva,  vagina, mouth, penis, anal cancer is caused by (HPV - In men, anal, mouth , throat & cock cancer). This virus is stunningly common, when left untreated, can go on to develop into cancer. 14 million new people get infected, with an estimated 79 million people infected in total, the most prevalent sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. Every year,  There are over 150 different kinds of HPV spread through skin to skin contact – about 40 of which infect the genital tract. The ubiquity of HPV and ease of transmission means that people who end up getting HPV usually do so when they’re young and with one of their first sexual partners.
Men who have HPV, will become the carriers of the viruses & spread them around (to their girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, massage parlors, escorts, long tho’ short anyone they have sexual contact with).  Some men who get HPV might not develop symptoms and the infection like many do, and they lie dormant, it’s like a ticking bomb. However, the HPV does not go away, it can cause genital warts or certain kinds of cancer.  So, they just keep spreading around & around like vicious cycle. Popular disinfectants do not kill HPV. HERSHEY, Pa. – Commonly used disinfectants do not kill human papillomavirus (HPV) that makes possible non-sexual transmission of the virus, thus creating a need for hospital policy changes, according to researchers from Penn State College of Medicine and Brigham Young University.
”
AND HAVE YOU GOT YOUR COLONOSCOPY, COLORECTAL, PROSTATE EXAMS, TESTICULAR EXAMS, PAP SMEARS, PELVIC EXAMS, BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS, ETC?  THOSE CANCERS (CERVICAL, PROSTATE, TESTICULAR, COLONS, RECTAL) ARE NUMBER 2 & 3 KILLERS IN THE U.S.
SOOOO, A MOMENT OF PLANNING MIGHT DO YOU GOOD. VACCINATION IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEDICINE THERE IS. AND ONLY COMPLETE LAB TEST, ONCE FOR NOW & 3 MONTHS AFTER, TO KNOW FOR SURE IF YOU HAVE “TERRORIST” A.K.A “HIV” EATING YOU FROM THE INSIDE…AND I HOPE IT’S NOT TOO LATE :-OOOOH ……👌👈😉😄❤️💅👀🙃✌️💕 
SOMEONE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV EVERY 35 HOURS
The Travis County Health &Human Services Dept released statistics, statistics revealing most noticeably, among heterosexuals WHITE, HISPANIC & Esp. BLACK.
IN AUSTIN, EVERY 35 HOURS SOMEONE IS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV! It’s estimated, 1,000 people are unaware they even have HIV.  The Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department (A/TCHHSD) released statistics (CLICK below:)
http://wiat.com/2016/03/17/someone-diagnosed-with-hiv-every-35-hours/
————————————-
Sooo, Go get tested for HIV NOW, and then 3 months after to be sure (so you can be on PrEP. And  also, get tested for HPV and HEPATITIS if you never have the vaccines before, or you’re late (Once you get 1 strain of HPV, it stays, no cure for HPV). 
AND get your colonoscopy, colorectal, Pelvic exam, bacterial vaginosis, & pep smear, so you won’t get anal cancers, colon cancers, OR vagina /cervical cancer,  and your wife/gf/bf too. So, good luck..

Thank you lord for all of the blessings, trials and opportunities that are in store for me, my business, my music, my creativity, my family and my brand in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest.

Women The risk of ischemic stroke Different strokes have diverse risk profiles in overweight women Tweet Staff Writer ▼ | Friday September 9, 2016 | 4 minutes ago According to new research, women who are overweight or obese may have an increased risk of the most common kind of stroke, called ischemic stroke, but a decreased risk of a more often deadly stroke, called hemorrhagic stroke. Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide and the fifth leading cause of death in the United States. READ MORE Obesity is three times deadlier for men than women ""We found that the risk of ischemic stroke, which is associated with a blockage of blood flow to the brain and is the most common stroke subtype, is increased in overweight and obese women. ""By contrast, the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which is associated with bleeding into the brain, is decreased in overweight and obese women,"" said study author Gillian Reeves, PhD, with the University of Oxford, United Kingdom. ""Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that different types of stroke have different risk profiles."" Kathryn Rexrode, MD, MPH, with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who wrote an accompanying editorial, noted that the lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke did not mean that overweight and obese women had a reduced risk of stroke overall. ""Higher body mass index, or BMI, was associated with increased risk of total stroke in every category and the number of ischemic strokes was higher than the number of hemorrhagic stroke in every category. So higher BMI was not associated with protection or reduced risk of total stroke,"" she said. ""Obesity is a substantial stroke risk factor for all ages and even more alarming for young adults."" For the study, 1.3 million women in the United Kingdom with an average age of 57 were followed for 12 years, during which time 20,549 had a stroke. Among the 344,534 women with a healthy weight (BMI between 22.5 and 25), 0.7 percent (2,253) had an ischemic stroke and 0.5 percent (1,583) had a hemorrhagic stroke. Of the 228,274 obese women (BMI 30 or more), 1.0 percent (2,393) had an ischemic stroke and 0.4 percent (910) had a hemorrhagic stroke. For every five-unit increase in BMI the risk of ischemic stroke increased by 21 percent. For hemorrhagic stroke, every five unit increase in BMI was associated with a 12 percent decrease in risk. The researchers also combined results from previously published studies. The totality of the worldwide evidence confirmed that risks associated with excess weight are consistently greater for ischemic than for hemorrhagic stroke. ■ What to read next

Josh Romney warns of possible 'permanent damage' to GOP by Donald Trump
SALT LAKE CITY — Josh Romney said Thursday it's tough for him and his father, former GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, to witness what may be ""permanent damage"" to the Republican Party from Donald Trump's candidacy.
The concern, Josh Romney told members of the BYU Management Society gathered at the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, is that the 2016 GOP nominee has hurt the party's image with minority voters because of his statements on race and religion.
""His Hispanic and black outreach has been minimal at best and harmful in many ways,"" Romney said, noting the billionaire businessman's efforts to win a larger percentage of white voters than past GOP candidates is not a winning one.
That's because, Romney said, his father ""would have won by a bigger landslide than Ronald Regan did against Jimmy Carter"" had the nation's demographics not changed since 1980 because he received a higher percentage of the white vote than Reagan.
Republicans have to recognize the dramatic shift in the country's makeup, he said, and Trump's talking of deporting people in the country illegally, making Mexico pay to build a border wall and banning Muslims have been harmful.
""So the concern is what Donald has done. Has it caused permanent damage to the Republican brand and the Republican Party among those minorities? Or is it something we can recover from? I'm not sure,"" Romney said.
He called it ""astonishing"" that Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party's pick for president, actually won their primary races and will be on the ballot in November.
What needs to happen, Romney said, is for political parties ""to revamp next time, nominate people who stand for something, that will bring us together, unite us as a country, that will tackle hard issues. I believe that can happen.""
This election year is going to be hard, especially on his father, said Romney, one of Mitt Romney's five sons.
Mitt Romney slammed Trump as a phony and a fraud in a high-profile speech at the University of Utah just before the state's March GOP presidential preference caucus vote, likely helping Trump finish a distant third.
The two-time presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor has said he will not vote for either Trump or Clinton, and has said he's considering the Libertarian Party ticket headed by former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson.
On Wednesday, Romney tweeted for the first time in two months, telling Twitter followers he hopes voters get to see Johnson and his running mate, another former Massachusetts governor, William Weld, participate in this fall's debates.
That's fueled speculation about a possible Romney endorsement, as has a recent meeting between a top Romney adviser in 2012 and a new entry into the presidential race, Evan McMullin, a Utah native and former CIA officer.
Josh Romney said his father would ""love to be there in the fight. He was really hoping to see a young star rise out of the Republican darkness"" after toying briefly with a third White House bid.
""It's tough and it's frustrating. We still talk about it a lot. He cares a lot about this country and about the party,"" Josh Romney said. ""It's tough to see what the party is going through.""
Josh Romney called himself a believer in the Republican Party of Lincoln and Reagan, ""not Donald Trump,"" and said he hopes the GOP ""can remake our brand a little bit next go-round and be more inclusive and more optimistic.""
Josh Romney, the president of a Utah-based real estate investment firm, has said he is considering a run for governor in 2020, but Thursday told a reporter he hasn't ""made a decision on anything, but I'm considering a lot of options.""

Tribune Media Wire,9/9/2016 5:31,"UTAH – Brigham Young University student and returned missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints who disappeared and was thought to have died in China in 2004 may be alive in North Korea .
According to a Yahoo Japan article , David Sneddon may have been kidnapped by the North Korean government years ago when he disappeared while hiking in western China.
The Chinese government suggested 24-year-old Sneddon died while hiking in Tiger Leaping Gorge in the Yunnan Province.
Sneddon's parents, Kathleen and Roy, say they have always been skeptical of that theory because their son's body was never recovered.
David Sneddon - HelpFindDavid.com
The article reports Sneddon is believed to have a wife and two children now and may be working as an English teacher, tutoring Kim Jong-un.
'I smiled at and laughed. Really come on? It could be. It’s kind of fun to think about,' says Kathleen Sneddon.
The Sneddons weren’t surprised to learn he was married with children. It was something they had been warned about by people in Japan who are familiar with North Korean abductions.
'If you’re married and have a child you’re not going to want to leave. You’ll be happy,' says Kathleen Sneddon.
The Sneddon’s have new hope after they say their son may have been spotted in Pyongyang, North Korea.

'They’ve captured him to come and help them. He’s an asset. Teach English, train their future spies because he knows the ways of America,' said Kathleen Sneddon.
They’ve been told that David is likely living a privileged life, but they’re still worried about how he’ll survive in this volatile foreign country.
'When you know that Kim Jong Un killed someone because they fell asleep in a meeting that’s kind of scary and that just happened two weeks ago,' says Kathleen Sneddon.
Politicians including Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Chris Stewart have a joint resolution that is part of an effort to find Sneddon.
'Get them together, get them to pool their information and put in effort to find David and bring him home,' says Kathleen Sneddon.
In the meantime, the Sneddon’s do their best to live their lives with their ten other children and thirty grandchildren.
'I feel cheated because I would’ve had another wonderful daughter in law with darling children because David would’ve been a great father. He is a great father I should say,' says Kathleen Sneddon.
They know if anyone could survive this, it would be David, their lemonade maker.
'David would make lemonade out of a lemon. He would make the best of it. David will,' says Kathleen Sneddon.

#ColinKaepernickSyllabus | New Black Man in Exile
On September 4, Rebecca Martinez tweeted Louis Moore and David J. Leonard, suggesting the creation of Colin Kaepernick Syllabus. Soon, we, along with  Bijan C. Bayne, Sarah J. Jackson, and many others began the work of creating a syllabus to hopefully elevate and empower the conversations that Colin Kaepernick started when he decided to sit down in protest during an August 26, 2016 preseason game.  
Building on the framework established by Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha Blain, with their monumental #CharlestonSyllabus, Marcia Chatelain with #FergusonSyllabus and subsequent efforts from Candice Benbow with #LemonadeSyllabus and others who have sought to not only use social media and online technology to crowdsource and aggregate conversations, this syllabus represents an effort to bring  together multiple conversations, histories, disciplines, discourses, and spaces.  If we are going to follow Colin Kaepernick’s lead to have conversations and work toward justice, we must do so with the necessary tools and collective understanding.  This requires engaging multiple conversations, entering into these spaces with a historic foundation, with knowledge about the persistent realities of racial injustice and inequality, with insight into the longstanding struggles of the Black athlete.  This syllabus represents an attempt to aid in these conversations, to turn our everyday conversations, debates, and discourse into a classroom, all while making sure our institutionalized classrooms are engaged with the histories, struggles, and public discourses that shape our current moment.  
Harry Edwards recently recently wrote, “silence is evil’s greatest and most consistently dependable ally.” For all those engaged in these conversations, for those who have written, spoke about, and organized around racial injustice, silence is antithetical to our work, our ethos.  Yet, too often people speak past one another; too many people presume because of the everyday saturation of sports culture, the ubiquity of media coverage of the Colin Kaepernick, and the hypervisibility (and invisibility) of racial discourse, along with the belief that this is all about opinions and “two sides” that they are prepared for these important conversations.   
Too often, especially within the media and from those whose whiteness - their privilege - insulates, empowers, and protects, people speak without the requisite tools, without the requisite historic foundation, and without necessary information. This offers a toolbox of knowledge, links to resources, and information. The #Kaepernick syllabus furthers the efforts to disrupt the silence, to make connections, and to otherwise build on the work of Kaepernick, Edwards, members of the WNBA, Bomani Jones, Serena Williams, and so many others demanding that we speak and act.  While continuing the conversation is important, it must be done so with literacy and knowledge about American racism, the history of sports, the African American athlete, #BLM, protests, and so much more.  Discussions aren’t inherently transformative but with the requisite understanding, introspection about privilege and widely-held assumptions, and critical examination, we are better equipped as we walk toward justice and radical transformation #KapernickSyllabus #WeSitWithKaep

Scott Richey’s storylines
BRANCHING OUT
Ali Bastianelli’s main strength has always been her block. That hasn’t changed this season, as the Illini sophomore middle blocker ranks 13th in the country and third in the Big Ten — behind Maryland’s Ashlyn McGregor and Wisconsin’s Tionna Williams — with 1.59 blocks per set. She showed that side of her game last weekend against Stanford, setting an Illinois record with 14 total blocks against the Cardinal. She unveiled a growing part of her game the next match against Colorado with 10 kills and just one error on 21 swings. 'We needed her, so maybe it forced us to use her a little bit more because we were struggling to score in other places,' Illinois coach Kevin Hambly said. 'I think that was great for us. We’ve been wanting her to get more involved and want the ball, and she did that and (sophomore setter Jordyn Poulter) found her and used her the right way.'
BUSINESS AS USUAL?
Hambly anticipates one challenge for Naya Crittenden in her return to Oregon after spending her first two seasons with the Ducks — making sure it’s Illinois vs. Oregon and not Naya Crittenden vs. Oregon. Sure, Crittenden wouldn’t mind beating her former team (although there are just half a dozen of her former teammates still on the roster), but she’s taking a different tact in heading back to Eugene. 'I think of it as another business trip for us,' Crittenden said. 'It’s another important game, and it’s another game for us to get better. Obviously I want to beat them, but it’s not something where I’m wanting it to be all about me like, ‘Oh, my gosh, I’m going back,’ because it doesn’t matter.'
They’re another team I want to beat, just like all the other games we’ve played the past couple weeks.'
APPRECIATING A CHALLENGE
Illinois has shown flashes of the top end of its potential through the first five matches of the season. Harnessing it more consistently is the challenge. 'I think we’re really hungry to win and frustrated we didn’t come out with the results, but it’s good to know that (the high moments) are there,' senior outside hitter Michelle Strizak said. 'We have all this potential. It makes me hopeful, but not just hopeful. We’re determined to make a change.' Hambly said he sees his team as a work in progress, a puzzle to solve throughout the season. 'I think we’re figuring all of it out,' he said. 'We’re figuring out what this team is still. We can play an easier schedule and be 5-0 or 6-0, but I’d much rather have these things to figure out now than to try and figure them out in the Big Ten.'

MYCHAMPLAINVALLEY,9/9/2016 5:42,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 12:21PM
Updated 09/08 2016 12:21PM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

centralillinoisproud.com,9/9/2016 5:46,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

Jack Coffin Posted: September 9, 2016 12:00 a.m. 
After a courageous battle with leukemia, our beloved father, John “Jack” Lavell Coffin, 81, slipped away peacefully with his son by his side on Sept. 4, 2016. 
He was born in Salt Lake City, Utah, on April 7, 1935, to Evelyn Mildred Condie and Lavell John Coffin. He is survived by his wife, Sara Jean Warner, and sister, Norma Martin. He leaves behind six children, 20 grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren and numerous close relatives. 
Jack grew up in Riverside, Calif., and graduated from Riverside Polytechnic (Poly) High in 1953. At 5’10”, he was the star basketball player for the Poly Bears. 
He married his high school sweetheart and Miss Riverside, Sara Jean Warner, on Sept. 17, 1954, in the Salt Lake Temple while he was attending Brigham Young University. In 1957, he graduated from BYU with a degree in business and soon after moved his new family to San Diego, where he worked as an elementary school teacher. By the early 1960s, Jack and his family of six relocated to Kalispell, Mont., and then to West Yellowstone, where he continued to teach, coach basketball, own a grocery store and raise six children. 
As a young boy, Jackie raised pigeons, chickens and rabbits, which he sold to the neighbors. He never had to ask his parents for money, as he was busy devising ways to make his own! He remembers how his mother made fried chicken for the Sunday meal with one of his birds! Grandma Evelyn made the best fried chicken he ever tasted. With a love for all animals, he taught his children how to respect and appreciate nature, too. As an avid outdoorsman, he enjoyed hunting both big game and birds, loved to fly fish and looked forward each year to harvesting huckleberries at Hebgen Lake. 
With a love for cats and like a cat with nine lives, nothing much slowed him down, not even his three heart attacks, tumbles off the rooftop, a black widow spider bite or being trampled by a horse on a hunting trip. And when the news came of his cancer in 2013, he faced each phase of the disease as courageously as a lion and lived each day to its fullest. Even then it was hard to keep him in his chair. We all know in our hearts that he hung on this past summer so he could partake in the family reunion given in his honor. For that, we are all thankful. 
Jack will always be remembered as a kind and loving, energetic and resourceful man that touched the lives of all. His bright blue eyes and sunny smile will shine on forever. 
The family extends their deepest gratitude and appreciation to the staff and community of Lincoln Court in Idaho Falls. The family would also like to express their great appreciation for the kindness, patience and support provided by the Hospice of Eastern Idaho caregivers. 
Funeral services will be held at 11 a.m. today, Sept. 9, at the LDS church at 310 Gibbon Ave., in West Yellowstone, Mont. The family will visit with friends one hour prior to the service at the church in West Yellowstone. Interment will be in the Fir Ridge Cemetery in West Yellowstone.

KTVE-TV,9/9/2016 6:00,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.

The Hypocrisy Of Utah’s Anti-Porn Crusade
CREDIT: SHUTTERSTOCK
Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) signed a piece of legislation on Tuesday that formally declares pornography to be a 'public health hazard' in his state.
This resolution, introduced in January by Senator Todd Weiler (R), rushed unopposed through the state Senate and House to make it to Herbert’s desk in a matter of months. Though it won’t impose a firm ban or criminal punishment, the legislation is a formal way for lawmakers to announce their disapproval of pornography.
Sen. Weiler’s resolution focuses heavily on how pornography warps children’s understanding of sex.
'Exposure to pornography often serves as children’s and youths’ sex education and shapes their sexual templates,' it reads . 'It teaches girls they are to be used and teaches boys to be users. This early exposure [to pornography] is leading to…an increase in problematic sexual activity at younger ages.'
Weiler, one of the majority Mormon members of state legislature, has compared pornography addiction to tobacco addiction and has said marriages destroyed by pornography will burden the state government.
'Ultimately, if someone gets divorced, that affects the government because we end up with more children and spouses on welfare and other things,' Weiler told the Salt Lake Tribune .
Unlike hard drugs, he said that pornographic images could 'haunt you for the rest of your life.' But the idea that pornography is a serious addiction has been rejected by multiple psychology organizations and researchers .
Plus, the risks of pornography are easily dwarfed when compared to the state’s history of skyrocketing STD rates among teens and a 36 percent rate of unintended pregnancies. Viewing pornography is one of the few sexual behaviors that isn’t partnered with these outcomes.
With one of the strictest laws around sex education in the country, the state offers little resources to help young people improve their sexual health. In February, the state legislature blocked a bill that would have replaced abstinence-only sex education with a more comprehensive curriculum, ruling that parents should be the only ones in charge of educating their children on sex.
Critics of the state’s anti-porn crusade believe it’s not worthy of the legislature’s precious time. In a February column, the editorial board of Utah’s Standard Examiner called it a hypocritical 'ceremonial assault.'
'Our legislators have no problem jumping on the anti-pornography resolution bandwagon, but efforts to have a comprehensive sex education program in Utah schools was swiftly and overwhelming defeated by a House committee,' the editors wrote.
Despite the lack of evidence to support it, the 'science' behind Weil’s resolution remains the selling point for most anti-porn organizations. The hip, Mormon-founded Fight The New Drug 'Porn Kills Love' campaign claims to 'keep things factual' with its research pulled mostly from Brigham Young University professors of Mormon family studies or Mormon neurologists.
In an interview with Rewire , clinical psychologist David Ley pointed to the real issue behind this fictitious fight.
'Porn isn’t addictive. It isn’t even harmful for the overwhelming majority of users. Fewer than one percent of porn users experience negative effects from their porn use,' Ley said. 'But ten percent of people are afraid of their porn use. The message here is that porn isn’t addictive — but fear might be.'

Salt Lake Tribune,9/9/2016 6:04,"Salt Lake Tribune partially wins appeal over records sought in its BYU assault investigation

ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (1)
The Salt Lake Tribune won, in part, an appeal to the State Records Committee on Thursday, requiring the Provo and Orem police departments to provide a report showing any instances of Brigham Young University officers accessing the two agencies' records through a shared countywide database.
Jessica Miller, a Tribune reporter, filed the appeal in July after the two agencies denied her initial requests, filed May 25. The records would contribute to the newspaper's investigation of students' assertions that they were targeted by BYU's Honor Code Office after reporting sexual assaults.
The Tribune previously obtained documents showing that one BYU police lieutenant accessed a Provo police record, purportedly so he could collect information for an Honor Code investigation into a female student who filed a rape case . He read the report by using the countywide database shared by 22 law enforcement agencies in Utah County, including Provo, Orem and BYU police.

Because BYU, which is owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is a private institution, it asserts that the BYU Police Department is not subject to records requests . The university has repeatedly stressed that the police department and Honor Code Office — which oversees the school's ban on alcohol, premarital sex and other conduct-based regulations — are separate.
The case logs, though, register details on the time, date and user who accesses a report, as well as what the user does with the document: view, print or amend. Each user is identified first by a two-digit code for his or her agency and then by name.
The State Records Committee unanimously voted Thursday to require Orem and Provo police to compile for The Tribune a report listing when a BYU user accessed an Orem or Provo record on the database — redacting the user ID and details about the case, such as names of suspects or victims.
Attorneys representing Provo and Orem police initially requested that the appeal be dismissed Thursday for filing errors made by The Tribune, but the committee denied the request.
During the hearing, Camille Williams, representing Provo police, said the two law enforcement agencies would have to create a database report that ""does not exist as a record,"" so the request should be denied. Williams also said it would be impossible to produce the report.
Chris Black, a systems administrator for the database, testified for the police agencies, saying there's no feasible way to compile the data into a report without a third-party software, which some of the agencies don't have.
The police agencies also argued that releasing the data would interfere with two Utah Department of Public Safety (DPS) investigations examining potential BYU violations related to access of the sexual assault reports, said Kevin Bolander, of the Utah attorney general's office.
According to Utah's Government Records Access and Management Act, or GRAMA, any public employee who has lawful access to protected records and improperly shares that information could be charged with class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
Bolander has reviewed records from the database logs during the investigation, he said, and worries about potentially classified and ""sensitive information"" being made public. The committee, however, said if Bolander and others working on the DPS investigation have access to reports generated from the case logs, it would be possible to compile the data in accordance with The Tribune's request.
""If they pulled it for [Bolander] to look at it,"" said committee member David Fleming, ""they can pull it for The Tribune and redact portions.""
Though blocking out the usernames will limit investigations into whether certain BYU police officers consistently view external reports more than others, Miller accepted the proposed redactions, instead of a ""blanket denial.""
As part of her appeal, Miller said she requested the records before they were classified as ""protected"" on May 26, when the investigation began at the request of BYU and Provo police. Additionally, she argued, divulging the frequency of BYU's database access doesn't ""reasonably"" interfere with the investigation.
The attorney representing Orem, Heather Schriever, disagreed, saying it's ""unclear"" who owns the rights to the data — the police groups or Spillman, the company that provides the database — meaning it may not be in the two agencies' jurisdiction to release the information. Committee members rejected the argument, noting that until ownership is determined, the law enforcement agencies must produce the request because their records comprise the case-log database.
The committee partially granted Miller's request, requiring Orem and Provo police to produce a database report covering the past 18 months — the agencies delete any older data periodically to save space on servers, Black said. Miller originally requested records of BYU police officers' viewing of the case logs from January 2010 to present.
The report would also include any instance of a BYU user viewing a case — rather than solely sexual assault cases — because the database doesn't allow records to be sorted by type.

Volleyball Olympian shows his medal to Prairie, Skyview teams Sander visits with teams prior to their match Thursday Taylor Sanders, U.S. men's volleyball Olympian show his bronze medal on Thursday, Sept. 8, 2016, at Prairie High School.

Published: September 8, 2016, 11:18 PM A A 
Before they took the court for their varsity volleyball match on Thursday, players from Skyview and Prairie gathered in a Prairie classroom to meet an Olympian. 
Taylor Sander, a member of the United States men’s volleyball team, was happy to share the experience of winning a bronze medal at the Rio Olympics. He showed off the medal he won when the United States edges Russia in the bronze medal match and answered questions about the life of a professional volleyball player. 
“To be able to come here today and share my experience with people who supported me, who watched us on TV and cheered us on, is cool for me,” Sander said. 
Sander is married to 2011 Skyview graduate Rachel McQuivey. The couple — who met at Brigham Young University where Rachel competed in track and field — are here for a post-Olympics visit. Family friend Kevin Shirley, whose daughter Hannah plays for Skyview, suggested Thursday’s gathering. 
Prairie senior Tessa Doerfler said that hearing an Olympian say he gets nervous during games resonated with her. 
“What he said about nerves and just being yourself on the court instead of trying to live up to expectations. Just play your game,” she said. “I get a lot nerves during a game, so hearing him being able to relate to that is really cool.” 
Skyview senior Hannah Shirley said it is nice to have an Olympian to look up to. She said Sander’s message about the importance of teamwork hits home. As does the amount of work he puts into his sport. 
“It was kind of inspiring to hear how when he was younger he didn’t expect to be in the Olympics and how he was able to reach that goal,” Shirley said. 
It was an experience relished by Sander, an outside hitter from Huntington Beach, Calif. Highlights were walking in the Opening Ceremony with Team USA and competing for a medal, he said. Sure, losing the semifinal match to Italy — a match the United States led 2-1 — was painful. 
“Now I’m, not so sad about it,” Sander said. “It’s something that we used for motivation in the bronze medal match. To be able to play for a medal was amazing. We relished that moment. We can’t win a gold medal, but we can end the season we had on a win.” 
Rachel Sander said supporting her husband in Rio was both stressful and rewarding. 
“I was in tears every time they announced Team USA. It was really humbling to be there,” she said. 
The travels continue next month. Taylor Sander, who previously played two seasons of professional volleyball in Italy, has a one-year contract to play for a pro volleyball team in China. 
“I’m excited,” Rachel said. “It’ll be a totally different experience.” Columbian Soccer, hockey and Community Sports Reporter 360-735-4521

630WPRO,9/9/2016 6:30,"Is this 1,700-year-old tablet the world's oldest obituary?
(CNN) A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians at the time. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
The reference to the woman's faith is what makes this translation significant, Blumell said.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

The discussion:
How do we deploy theological and institutional resources already within our grasp to foster reconciliation in a church membership seemingly hopelessly divided between the “orthodox” and “doubters”?  Some of the greatest challenges—but also most important lessons—appear while we work in the laboratory of love that we call the church.  Maintaining belief is essential, but Christ also calls upon us to live out our discipleship within the context of a flesh-and-blood community that makes demands of us and gives us assignments and opportunities to take a lively interest in other people.  Perhaps the most important thing we can do in the face of our current challenges is to make the church a more welcoming place for those who struggle, creating the conditions in which they can feel comfortable while they work through questions in the midst of the body of Christ rather than feeling excluded from it.  A more embracing Mormonism may thus be the most important factor in helping people more fully embrace Mormonism.

Eight-year-old boy digs up 140-million-year-old dinosaur skull near Junction
Julia McHugh, curator of paleontology for the Museum of Western Colorado, shows an apatosaurus louisae skull encased in plaster that was discovered in July at the Mygatt-Moore Quarry by 8-year-old Lachlan Barrett of Florida while participating in the museum's dinosaur dig vacation with his grandmother. It is only one of four such skulls that have been discovered, according to McHugh.
The snout of apatosaurus louisae, as it appeared on the day of its discovery earlier in the summer.
By Gary Harmon
Friday, September 9, 2016
A 140-million-year-old skull that belonged to a hapless plant-munching dinosaur is bound for a place of honor at the Museums of Western Colorado's Dinosaur Journey in Fruita.
The skull, discovered this summer by an 8-year-old Florida boy on the museum's dinosaur dig at the Mygatt-Moore Quarry, is believed to be that of an apatosaurus louisae. If that proves out, it would become just the fourth known such specimen and the only one with vertebrae still attached.
""This is going to be one of our iconic exhibits,"" said Julia McHugh,  curator of paleontology at Dinosaur Journey and a doctoral faculty member at Colorado Mesa University.
It's a long way, however, between the discovery in July and displaying the full skull. Preparing the skull at Dinosaur Journey is a yearlong process that McHugh is confident will reveal the brain case and eye orbits.
For now, the top of the head remains encased in rock and only the palate, and some tell-tale teeth roots, are visible.
It was those tooth roots that intrigued young Lachlan Barrett and which got McHugh's full attention when Lachlan mentioned them to her during a dinosaur dig at the quarry.
Sauropods such as the long-necked, long-tailed apatosaurs, had peg-like teeth used to rip free and grind up plant material.
Woody material, however, could do as much damage to teeth as teeth did to food, so when teeth were crushed or ripped out, new, circular ones were lined up behind in the jaw, ready to move into place.
""When I saw all those little rows of Cheerios, I knew we had something good,"" McHugh said.
The skull, which measures some 600 millimeters from the end of the snout to the bony protrusion at which the vertebra attach to the skull - was found some 4 feet below the surface and all that overburden had to be removed before the next secret of the skull could be revealed.
Taking off the overlaying rock produced some allosaur wrist bones, which are rare finds in themselves. Once the digging was down to the level of the skull, McHugh worked around behind it and found the articulated - meaning attached - vertebrae.
The vertebrae make the skull unique among the four known or suspected apatosaur skulls.
That's a small sample size, McHugh said, so there is still much to learn.
""I'm not entirely convinced that this is an adult,"" McHugh said, noting that it's difficult to say, given the small sample size of apatosaurs.
Sauropod skulls are rare because they were extraordinarily light in life and they tended to fall apart into dozen of pieces in death, said Brooks Britt, formerly chief paleontologist at the Museum of Western Colorado and now at Brigham Young University.
""We call them the headless wonders"" because skulls are so difficult to find, Britt said. ""Sauropod skulls are always rare. To find an articulated skull, that's just fantastic.""

1,700-year-old obituary translated

(CNN) -
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.

Lynda Dickson,9/9/2016 7:00,"EXCERPT and GIVEAWAYSlave Queen(Omar Zagouri Thriller Book 3)by H. B. MooreSlave Queen is the third book in the Omar Zagouri Thriller series by USA Today bestselling author H. B. Moore. Also available: Finding Sheba, Lost King, (read my blog post), Beneath (a short story), and First Heist (a novella found in A Timeless Romance Anthology: Autumn Collection).This book blast and giveaway is brought to you by I Am A Reader. DescriptionSpecial Agent Omar Zagouri’s latest case is his most dangerous - and his most personal yet. The discovery of secret sixteenth-century letters unveils a plot between the sultan Suleyman and his chief wife, Roxelane, to change the course of the Ottoman Empire. A descendent of Roxelane, Zagouri learns he has an enemy whose revenge has been centuries in the making.Targeted by an antiquities collector who’s also descended from a chief rival for the ancient throne, Zagouri soon uncovers a modern-day conspiracy that threatens the lives of his family and the security of a nation.To expose the plot, Zagouri must team up with Naim, the son of his nemesis, who heads an international black-market operation that may have ties to the killings. From ancient Constantinople to the present-day Middle East, Zagouri is on a collision course with history. Time is running out to solve a royal mystery and stop a ruthless killer - one who has Zagouri’s name on his hit list.ExcerptChapter OneAl Karak, JordanRashed Sayid picked up his cell phone and selected his most trustworthy contact. The phone call would take only moments, but the result would teach the entire Sayid tribe what honor meant. He shut his third-floor office window, blocking out the rising heat of the Jordanian desert’s summer morning. He and his only brother owned the bank in the city of Al Karak, having started the bank three decades before, and now they were among the wealthiest in town.“Yes?” Yamil answered.“We have proof,” Rashed said into the phone.“Four male witnesses?” Yamil asked.Rashed blew out a breath. Yamil was a stickler for rules. An execution couldn’t be ordered unless there were four respected male witnesses to the crime. There were actually no witnesses, but Rashed knew his daughter was guilty. He had plenty of video footage of her leaving her university apartment more than once after midnight, and he also had other, less legal evidence. There was only one reason for his daughter’s midnight forays. Worst case scenario, Aamira was no longer a virgin. Next case scenario, she’d been tainted in some way by having a relationship with a man other than her fiancé. Rashed was still working on trying to find out whom she was meeting. But it was time to put the execution order into motion.[Want more? Click below to read a longer excerpt.]Praise for the Book""Moore does an excellent job of setting the scene of international intrigue, and although this novel is part of a series, it also works well as a stand-alone. The story jumps back and forth between the present and the past as Moore tells the story of Roxelane’s capture by the Turkish army and her subsequent love affair with Suleiman. Roxelane is an excellent, strong female character, and Moore brings some obscure players from the Ottoman Empire vividly to life. She even quotes from Suleiman’s actual poetry ... to conjure a complex portrait of this larger-than-life figure. A satisfying historical thriller."" ~ Kirkus Reviews""From sultans and hierarchies that separate men and women from Poland to Constantinople and beyond to new lives in great cities where mosques and sultans rule, these vivid past and present scenarios contribute to a story fueled by cultural revelations and the long-standing threat a series of letters reveals. The result is a fast-paced, complex, and absorbing adventure saga that crosses time and place to give Omar, Mia (and readers) a run for their money. Warning: once begun, it’s nearly impossible to put down the full-flavored, multi-faceted Slave Queen, which reveals many insights about the Ottoman Empire, Süleyman the Magnificent, and the slave girl foreigner who turned out to be his favorite wife."" ~ D.

Familiar foes BYU and Utah have close ties Posted: September 9, 2016 1:05 a.m.

SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — BYU and Utah may have as much crossover within the two programs as any two major football schools in the country. 
BYU coach Kalani Sitake was the Utah defensive coordinator just two seasons ago and was one of the first hires by 12th-year Utes coach Kyle Whittingham. 
That dynamic makes it a little different than other rivalries across the nation. It doesn’t have the national cache of Michigan-Ohio State or Alabama-Auburn but the animosity in the state is very real. The two meet next on Saturday in Salt Lake City. 
“I just want to shut them up, honestly,” Utah receiver Tim Patrick said. “I hear about it 24-7 since I got here. I experienced it in the bowl game. Seen videos of the trash talking. I want to be on the winning end, on that side. Be one of the guys that shuts them up.” 
Whittingham and three Utah assistants played at BYU while Sitake and three of his assistants were once on the Utah staff. Guy Holliday went from coaching receivers at BYU last season to Utah now. 
Brothers Kai Nacua (BYU) and Samson Nacua (Utah) will be on opposite sidelines and BYU defensive end Harvey Langi began his collegiate career at Utah. 
As heated as the rivalry can get, both sides have downplayed how much the familiarity will actually factor in Saturday. Though Whittingham acknowledged Holiday has provided some insight on individual players. 
“With anything with social media, that kind of fuels the fire a lot of times for people,” BYU offensive coordinator Ty Detmer said. “It’s definitely more intense, probably, then when I was here because you didn’t hear that part of it and see some of those things. That adds to it a little bit. But with Kalani having been there a long time and the fans loving him when he coached at Utah, there’s maybe not the bitterness that has been there in the past.” 
Sitake grew up a BYU fan and played for the Cougars before being joining the Utah staff for a decade. He and Whittingham golfed together multiple times during the summer and remain close friends. 
Sitake’s presence may have an impact on the vitriol, but it was just December when former Utah defensive tackle Seni Fauonuku called BYU “a dirty team” before the two played in the Las Vegas Bowl — a 35-28 Utah win. 
BYU linebacker Fred Warner remembers. 
“Just the way they came at us during the bowl game and some of the activities, just didn’t feel right,” Warner said. 
It was just January when Utah men’s basketball coach Larry Krystkowiak canceled the series between the two teams due to a “venomous and toxic environment.” Utah lawmakers then ordered an audit of the University of Utah sports department after the game was canceled. The athletic directors decided to renew the series in 2017-18. 
Utah defensive end Kylie Fitts thinks it’s the nastiest rivalry in the country. 
“You guys don’t hear or see what goes on on the field and under the piles,” Fitts said. “It’s nasty, but there’s definitely respect for both teams. … It’s electric. You can feel it in the air. You can feel it in practice. You can feel it in the weight room. For me personally, I feel it’s as heated as it’s ever been.” 
The upperclassmen on the Utah defense were recruited by Sitake and Fitts said the BYU coach is basically the reason he’s at Utah. 
BYU defensive end Corbin Kaufusi has been on both sides since his dad Steve flipped from the Utah staff to the BYU staff in 2002. 
“I remember my older brother and my little brother, we used to always paint our faces black with the red,” Kaufusi said. “It’s kind of funny to be on the other side of it now. I remember when I was younger, it did seem like it got a little snippy and there were times where it’s a little dirtier than it needs to be.” Rate this article:

ALLEN PARK – As fantastic as Ezekiel Ansah was previous time – and the quantities say he was extremely fantastic – the Detroit Lions coaching team thinks the ideal is but to come from the fourth-calendar year defensive conclusion.
""He was a Pro Bowler previous calendar year,"" mentor Jim Caldwell said Thursday. ""That's really an honor and it tells you correct there that he is a person of the ideal in the league. If you inquire me the query do I feel he can get better, I unquestionably do.
""I feel you can see that if he stays balanced, you can see an even better model of him because he is just actually starting to scratch the surface of all of the matters he is able of executing in the context of our all round scheme from a defensive standpoint.
""He's a rather special male. All you have to do is choose a glimpse at the film and you glimpse at practice film, he does matters that no a person else does. He has some extremely unusual characteristics and attributes.""
In 3 seasons considering that being the fifth all round pick in the 2013 NFL draft out of BYU, Ansah has started out forty four of 46 video games and recorded a full of 30 sacks.
He had 7.five sacks as a rookie, eight the adhering to calendar year and 14.five previous time to end third in the NFL.
All this from a male who grew up in Ghana and didn't choose up football right until he was in college or university. He arrived to The united states to try out and play basketball at BYU but was lower 2 times prior to at last turning to football in 2010.
Five many years later on, Ansah was named to his 1st Pro Bowl.
Does that mean the 6-foot-five, 275-pound Ansah is on the verge of being an upper-echelon defender in the NFL?
""I feel he is currently there,"" said defensive coordinator Teryl Austin. ""This male is as fantastic a football player as I've ever been around.""
Given his results previous time, Ansah appreciates he'll be a marked person starting in Sunday's time opener at Indianapolis.
But Ansah is just not concentrating on any particular goals. He claims he just desires to aid the Lions acquire a lot more video games while strengthening individually just about every time.
""I just come out just about every day just to perform,"" he said. ""Just be the ideal that I can be, just to increase on the matters that I need to have. Certainly groups do pay back focus to me. We just acquired to discover a way to defeat that.""
For that to occur – and for the Lions' defense to increase on a inadequate time – Ansah said most people will have to up their video games.
The Lions slipped previous time right after proudly owning the second-ideal defense in 2014 prior to getting rid of Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley to no cost company.
Accidents didn't aid previous time.
Two players predicted to fill major roles on defense – tackle Haloti Ngata and linebacker DeAndre Levy – were hurt the whole calendar year. Ngata battled accidents that involved his shoulder, calf and neck while Levy played just a person sport because of a hip ailment.
This time, the Lions are balanced defensively and that has Ansah confident they're going to be much enhanced.
""It feels fantastic, feels fantastic to have all the fellas back,"" Ansah said. ""Haloti is executing a huge job, causing havoc in the center. We have DeAndre back.
""I feel our D tackles and our ends play hand in hand. I feel it is a combination of this side encouraging the other side and working hand in hand.""
But if the Lions are going to return to possessing an elite defensive, it is very likely going to begin with Ansah.
""He's a male that didn't play from the time he was 8, 9 and 10 many years previous like a good deal of fellas but he has all the required instruments to be superb,"" Caldwell said. ""And he has a true nasty streak in him, which I feel is one thing that helps make a huge variation.""

ozarksfirst.com,9/9/2016 7:16,"Text written in ancient Greek
By Bianca Britton for CNN
Published 09/08 2016 11:21AM
Updated 09/08 2016 11:21AM
(CNN)
A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

ASEAN important for safeguarding India's security interests: PM Modi
Tracey Rhodes
Thu, September 08, 2016
""At their second bilateral summit this year, President Park and Prime Minister Abe will center their focus on the North Korean nuclear issue and ways to develop bilateral relations and cooperation"".
Prime Minister Narendra Modi will leave on Wednesday for Laos on a two-day visit to attend the annual India-ASEAN and East Asia summits.
Apart from the 10 ASEAN member states, East Asia Summit includes India, China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Russian Federation.
Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc had a cordial meeting with Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith of Laos in Vientiane on September 6 prior to the opening session of the 28th and 29th ASEAN Summits and related meetings.
The meeting between the leaders of the United States and the Philippines has been mutually agreed upon to be moved to a later date, said a statement issued by Mr Duterte's office on Tuesday.
In November 2004, in a presentation to the Eighth China-ASEAN Summit in Laos, then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao made 10 proposals for further mutual cooperation. ASEAN is South Korea's second-largest trade partner with two-way trade reaching $119 billion past year.
Hillary Clinton Emails Must Be Released By State Department In September: Judge
Trust us that donations to the Clinton Foundation were totally isolated from Clinton's official business at State. Yet the frequency of the overlaps shows the mixing of access and donations.
At the 14th ASEAN-India Summit, Mr. Modi and ASEAN Leaders will review ASEAN-India cooperation and discuss its future direction under each of the three pillars of politico-security, economic and socio-cultural cooperation.
But with recent turbulence over outstanding disputes and the dynamic landscape of Asian geopolitics, Jokowi has grown increasingly concerned about regional stability, especially in regard to attempts by external parties to project their interests onto the region.
The year 2016 marks the 25th anniversary of the dialogue relationship between China and ASEAN.
India and ASEAN have 30 dialogue mechanisms which meet regularly, including a Summit and 7 Ministerial meetings in Foreign Affairs, Commerce, Tourism, Agriculture, Environment, Renewable Energy and Telecommunications. The ASEAN-India economic integration process has got a fillip with the creation of the ASEAN-India Free Trade Area in July 2015, following the entry into force of the ASEAN-India Trade in Services and Investment Agreements.
Asean India Summit will play an important role in boosting India's ""Act-East Policy"".
""Right after Asia's financial crisis, the two sides held their first South Korea-ASEAN summit (in 1997)"".

Downtown Salt Lake City,9/9/2016 7:29,"09-10-2016 to 09-10-2016 - Fly Me to the Moon is the latest project from award-winning Utah producer, Caleb Chapman. The quintet, comprised of Utah’s top young professional talent is fronted by vocalist, Isaac Major. He is joined by his childhood neighbor, Ben Cutler on tenor saxophone. Rounding out the rhythm section are Kurt Reeder on piano, Creedence McNabb on bass, and the band’s youngest member, award-winning drummer, Porter Chapman. In the spirit of Sinatra, Crosby, Bennett, and Cole, the band’s performances fuse an infectious swagger with stunning musicianship. The result is a nostalgic setlist of America’s most beloved songs presented with a style and sophistication that is becoming increasingly scarce in today’s live performances.
Isaac Major, Vocals
Born and raised in Pleasant Grove Utah, Isaac has years of experience performing with Caleb Chapman’s Crescent Super Band. Previous to that, he cut his teeth with the Voodoo Orchestra. He has performed at Carnegie Hall and stages across the region. He can often be heard on Utah’s FM100 during the holiday season when his recording of “I’ll Be Home for Christmas” with the Crescent Super Band gets significant airplay.
Benton Cutler, Saxophone
Musician, artist and designer, Benton cultivates his artistic lifestyle through a wide variety of genres. Playing saxophone since the age of 8, his sound has grown and matured into a rich and dark voice on tenor, alto and soprano saxophones, as well as flute and piano. He continues his career in music by attending Snow College, performing in all their top jazz performance groups and will be graduating early 2017. He also plays a wide variety of music in an array of different groups around Utah, featuring straight ahead jazz, pop, jazz fusion and hip hop. He has worked with and shared the stage most recently with the likes of legendary drummer Carl Allen, and Rashawn Ross of the Dave Matthews Band.
Kurt Reeder, Piano
Kurt has followed his love for jazz since age 12 when he began studying jazz exclusively. After a bachelorsdegree earned at Brigham Young University in Jazz Studies, he went on to earn a Masters Degree in Jazz Performance from California State University Fullerton where he had a chance to study and work with amazing musicians in the Southern California Scene, as well as direct the University’s salsa band. In the meantime he has had four children with his beautiful wife, Candice. Kurt is currently teaching the keyboard masterclass at Pioneer High School for the Performing Arts and Jazz Piano at Utah Valley University, as well as working as a freelance musician throughout the intermountain west.
Creedence McNabb, Bass
Creedence began his love for music over 10 years ago and has continued feeding that passion by growing his private instruction studio and working towards a degree in Commercial Music at Snow College. You'll find him playing at Color Festivals nationally and weddings statewide with a large variety of musicians and musical genres. He is an alumnus of Caleb Chapman’s Soundhouse.
Porter Chapman, Drums
At just 16 years old, Porter has already made a big impression on Utah’s music scene as one of the most exciting and innovative drummers in the state. He has studied with many of the greatest drummers of all time including Steve Smith (Journey), NduguChancler (Michael Jackson, Weather Report), Dave Weckl (Chick Corea), Terreon Gully (Christian McBride), Keith Carlock (Sting, Steely Dan, Toto), Poncho Sanchez, Bernie Dresel (Brian Setzer, Gordon Goodwin’s Big Phat Band), and several others. Even at a young age Porter has already played major stages around the country including San Francisco, New Orleans, New York, Los Angeles, Seattle, San Diego, and more. The highlight of his career to date was making his concert debut with his father for a packed house at Carnegie Hall.

There’s also this from CBS, buried halfway through Dennis Dodd’s comically-long weekly column:
Two-loss team in the CFP? With four teams in the top 11 losing in Week 1, perhaps this is a possibility. Essentially, LSU, Oklahoma, Tennessee Volunteers and Ole Miss have to win out to have a chance. While few were giving the Vols and Rebels a chance, when the Tigers and Sooners lost it marked the first time two top five teams were defeated in Week 1 since 1972.
...which is either some excellent low-key trolling, or what happens when you fire all your actual writers, we guess.
So not great! But luckily, there’s a game in two days. In the words of warrior-poet JRM:

Moving on.
HokieHoedownTurkeytête-à-têteGOBBLERTALKSome Links About Virginia TechJustin Fuente gave a predictably anodyne press conference yesterday, calling the Vols ""loaded across the board,"" while The Key Play has a lengthy discussion of Bud Foster’s comments about the Vols.
The Hokies ran 89 plays last week, a blistering pace compared to the Beamer era, and are looking to run even faster this week. If you’re interested in what specifically to expect out of Fuente’s (deservedly) vaunted offense, SBN’s own Gobbler Country has a fantastic breakdown of their game against Liberty, building on their similarly great cutups/analysis series over the offseason, covering Fuente 101, route concepts, quarterback play, and red zone packages.
They also break down our Thursday game (spoiler alert: the line was dismal) and briefly ponder whether Dobbs will play Saturday (spoiler alert: he will). (Actually, doubling back for a second: Dave Hooker is dumb.) MOVING ON.
Yo Dawg I Heard You Like PreviewsAs usual, Brad at B/R has a fine writeup previewing the Saturday’s game (with slides, though BOO HISS). Sporting News does one of those things with a bunch of numbers for section headers that are gasp actually vaguely relevant stats. Fox has a super-boring preview that predicts nothing, Chip Patterson at CBS picks VT to cover the 11.5 point spread, and Sportblog is calling an on-the-moneyline 27-17 Tennessee victory. Fun fact: both schools look to make more than four million dollars off the game, which interestingly is exactly $4m more than the players actually playing the game are expected to earn.
OTHER STUFFPractice carries on, and Tuesday afternoon freshman wide receivers Marquez Callaway and Brandon Johnson both lost their helmet stripes.
Mike DeBord apparently agrees Kamara needs more touches. OCs, they’re just like us!
Tennessee President Joe DiPietro announced Tuesday the members of the new special commission to address sexual assault throughout the University of Tennessee system. The creation of the commission, which will begin by assessing the Title IX practices and procedures of all UT campuses, was announced in July following the $2.48 million settlement of the Title IX lawsuit.
In case you missed it, the Big 12 is having a sort of bizarre reality competition to decide who will next join the conference, and Memphis is evidently out as a candidate. Air Force, BYU, UCF, Cincinnati, Colorado State, UConn, Houston, Rice, South Florida, SMU and Tulane are the remaining schools being considered. I’m going to go ahead and say UCF is Chad.
The NFL, a boringly elaborate mechanism for producing fantasy football statistics, is wrapping up final roster cuts, and SI’s MMQG has a fascinating (and frankly really poignant) look at life on the roster bubble (really, read it, it’s good). Incidentally, GVX points out that Miami now leads the NFL in Vawlness, with five former Vols on roster (Arian Foster, Justin Hunter, Matt Darr, Dallas Thomas and Ja'Wuan James).

#ColinKaepernickSyllabus | New Black Man in Exile
On September 4, Rebecca Martinez tweeted Louis Moore and David J. Leonard, suggesting the creation of Colin Kaepernick Syllabus. Soon, we, along with  Bijan C. Bayne, Sarah J. Jackson, and many others began the work of creating a syllabus to hopefully elevate and empower the conversations that Colin Kaepernick started when he decided to sit down in protest during an August 26, 2016 preseason game.  
Building on the framework established by Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha Blain, with their monumental #CharlestonSyllabus, Marcia Chatelain with #FergusonSyllabus and subsequent efforts from Candice Benbow with #LemonadeSyllabus and others who have sought to not only use social media and online technology to crowdsource and aggregate conversations, this syllabus represents an effort to bring  together multiple conversations, histories, disciplines, discourses, and spaces.  If we are going to follow Colin Kaepernick’s lead to have conversations and work toward justice, we must do so with the necessary tools and collective understanding.  This requires engaging multiple conversations, entering into these spaces with a historic foundation, with knowledge about the persistent realities of racial injustice and inequality, with insight into the longstanding struggles of the Black athlete.  This syllabus represents an attempt to aid in these conversations, to turn our everyday conversations, debates, and discourse into a classroom, all while making sure our institutionalized classrooms are engaged with the histories, struggles, and public discourses that shape our current moment.  
Harry Edwards recently recently wrote, “silence is evil’s greatest and most consistently dependable ally.” For all those engaged in these conversations, for those who have written, spoke about, and organized around racial injustice, silence is antithetical to our work, our ethos.  Yet, too often people speak past one another; too many people presume because of the everyday saturation of sports culture, the ubiquity of media coverage of the Colin Kaepernick, and the hypervisibility (and invisibility) of racial discourse, along with the belief that this is all about opinions and “two sides” that they are prepared for these important conversations.   
Too often, especially within the media and from those whose whiteness - their privilege - insulates, empowers, and protects, people speak without the requisite tools, without the requisite historic foundation, and without necessary information. This offers a toolbox of knowledge, links to resources, and information. The #Kaepernick syllabus furthers the efforts to disrupt the silence, to make connections, and to otherwise build on the work of Kaepernick, Edwards, members of the WNBA, Bomani Jones, Serena Williams, and so many others demanding that we speak and act.  While continuing the conversation is important, it must be done so with literacy and knowledge about American racism, the history of sports, the African American athlete, #BLM, protests, and so much more.  Discussions aren’t inherently transformative but with the requisite understanding, introspection about privilege and widely-held assumptions, and critical examination, we are better equipped as we walk toward justice and radical transformation #KapernickSyllabus #WeSitWithKaep

University attrition rates: Why are so many students dropping out?
Liz Burke, news.com.au
September 9, 2016 7:48am
FIRST year university students are leaving their original chosen courses at a higher rate than ever.
New data shows about one in five commencing bachelor students left their original course in 2014, and about 15 per cent dropped out completely.
The figures also see the increase in the number of students not completing their chosen course climb to more than one million for the first time.
Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, are defending the figures. They point out that while overall attrition rates are up, when it comes to the percentage of students dropping out of university completely in their first year (the adjusted attrition rate), the average figure is similar to past years, sticking at around 15 per cent for the past decade.
But the number of students leaving their first year courses is increasing — whether they find another place for themselves in the higher education system or not.
At the university with the worst attrition rate, the University of Tasmania, 42.26 per cent of first year students left their course during the first year, with most of those — 38.13 per cent of all first year students — dropped out of university altogether.
The University of Melbourne had the lowest attrition rate at 7.5 per cent. Its adjusted rate — taking out students who had left their course but enrolled in another — was only 3.74 per cent.
Universities Australia Deputy Chief Executive Catriona Jackson told news.com.au the attrition rates were no indictment on tertiary education providers. Rather, it was a “major achievement” that university access had been expanded to more Australians while keeping the dropout rate relatively stable.
“Research suggests attrition rates are higher for mature age and part-time students — and if you think about it, they’re the ones who may often be juggling university study with jobs, children and caring for elderly parents,” she said.
“Students battling disadvantage — including those who are first in their family to attend university — are also more likely to have thoughts about leaving.”
The experiences of disadvantaged students highlighted the importance of student support programs run by universities, which help students to find the support and resources they need to complete their degree, Ms Jackson said.
“The biggest factors for students who consider leaving university are often related to issues beyond university,” she said.
“They cite pressures with their health or stress, juggling work/life balance, the need to do paid work, their overall workload and financial difficulties among the top reasons for doing so.”
Grattan Institute higher education expert Andrew Norton told The Australian the attrition rates were worrying.
“The question is: are universities actually informing students of the risks they are taking on, particularly studying online, and are they being responsible in taking on students who are at high risk of not completing?”
The new data comes as the Federal Government awaits a report detailing recommendations about how best to make things clearer for students and keep them better informed.
The Higher Education Standards Panel, which is currently reviewing submissions over university admissions, has acknowledged greater transparency for students is needed to reshape higher education.

On Wednesday evening, the Iowa State student government passed a resolution against Brigham Young University joining the Big 12 according to an art icle from the Iowa State Daily. 
Iowa State SGA senators state, “BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12,” as the reason behind the resolution. 
The resolution was passed 21-6 with the six senators in opposition citing freedom of speech issues. 
Iowa State SGA plans on sending the resolution to the presidents of all the Big 12 Universities, including Kansas State Interim President General Richard Myers, and Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby. 
The Cougars are thought to be high on the list of candidates for Big 12 expansion. 
The Mormon university based out of Provo, Utah has come under fire multiple times this year for issues involving their honor code. 
In April, a former BYU student reported that she was suspended from the University after reporting her rape according to a New York Times article. The reason for her suspension was for violation of the honor code after admitting to school officials that she had been coerced into an earlier sexual encounter with the same student who had raped her and that she had used LSD the night she was raped. 
In August, 25 different LGBT groups signed a letter penned by Athlete Ally, a non-profit, pro-LGBT group, wrote to Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby, urging the conference not to consider BYU for expansion according to an article by Fox Sports. 
BYU’s honor code specifically states: “Homosexual behavior is inappropriate and violates the Honor Code. Homosexual behavior includes not only sexual relations between members of the same sex, but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings.”

(File Photo by Parker Robb | The Collegian) 
After a thrilling first week of college football that included a double overtime shootout in Austin, a three touchdown comeback in Orlando and a massive upset by South Alabama over Mississippi State in Starkville, it’s time to get ready for this week’s matchups. Here are some of the best games to look out for. 
BYU vs. Utah 
The Holy War is back. The Utah Utes will be hosting the Brigham Young University Cougars Saturday at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, Utah, with a kickoff time of 7:30 p.m. EST. 
The Utes claim an all-time 58-34-4 record against the Cougars, but the Cougars claim that the Utes only lead 55-31-4. The reason for the difference is the Utes count six games played against Brigham Young Academy, BYU’s original name from 1875-1903, but BYU considers their first matchup to be in 1922, which BYU considers to be its inaugural season. 
The Cougars come into the encounter after an 18-16 victory over the Arizona Wildcats on a last-second field goal from kicker Jake Oldroyd last weekend in Glendale. Most of the Cougars’ yards on offense came from running back Jamaal Williams, who logged 29 carries and rushed for 162 yards. The BYU defense is also a force to be reckoned with. After questions were being asked about BYU’s switch to a 4-3 defense, the Cougars responded to the critics by sacking Arizona quarterback Anu Solomon four times and had eight tackles for a loss. 
The Utes head into the matchup after a 24-0 victory over Southern Utah. Despite not winning by the margin that the Utes were hoping for, there were still some positives to take away. Quarterback Troy Williams threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns. Plus, the Utah defense stuffed Southern Utah to only 158 offensive yards. Safety Marcus Williams recorded a forced fumbled, a fumble recovery and an interception. Look forward to a heated battle in Salt Lake City. 
Virginia Tech vs. No. 17 Tennessee 
This game could be really interesting, especially when you take the venue into consideration. Already labeled as “The Battle at Bristol,” this game will be taking place at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tennessee. The current record for attendance at a college football game is 115,109, which was set back in 2013 when Michigan hosted Notre Dame at the “Big House.” This matchup is expected to attract more than 150,000 people. 
The Tennessee Volunteers enter this matchup with a series lead against the Hokies of 5-3-0. The Volunteers suffered a scare last weekend, as underdog Appalachian State managed to scrape its way into overtime, only losing 20-13. Senior quarterback Joshua Dobbs will be looking to provide better decision-making this week after his struggles against the Appalachian State pass rush. Junior running back Jalen Hurd will be anticipating a good day after his 110 yards on the ground against Appalachian State, along with the game-winning fumble recovery in the end zone. 
The Virginia Tech Hokies had an ugly win themselves last weekend as they toppled the Liberty Flames 36-13. Though on paper the scoreline doesn’t look bad, the Hokies lost four fumbles to the FCS competition and only led 17-13 with 24 seconds left in the second quarter. New head coach Justin Fuente will be looking to quiet the critics as this is his first real test since taking over in Blacksburg, Virginia after Frank Beamer, Hokies coach of 29 seasons, retired. 
Arkansas vs. No. 15 TCU 
Despite the scary No. 15 ranking that TCU has attached to its name this week, Arkansas should have a feeling heading into Fort Worth that maybe it can pull this one off. Neither of these two sides looked convincing in their first week victories. The Arkansas Razorbacks hold a 43-23-2 series lead over the Horned Frogs but the last time these two played was all the way back in 1991, when Arkansas just edged out TCU 22-21. 
The Horned Frogs are looking to improve on last week’s performance because despite winning 59-41, giving up 461 yards and 41 points to the South Dakota State Jackrabbits is outright terrible. Replacing last year’s phenom Trevone Boykin, quarterback Kenny Hill wants to continue his form from last week. Though he didn’t start too well, he finished the game with 439 yards in the air and two passing touchdowns, along with three rushing scores. 
The Razorbacks narrowly edged Louisiana Tech last week, 21-20. Keon Hatcher was huge for Arkansas with his 12.7 yards per target and 85 percent success rate, finishing with six catches for 89 yards on seven attempts. However, if Arkansas wants to win this game, it needs to revive its running game. Rawleigh Williams III led the Razorbacks, producing only 96 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries with an average of 4 yards per carry. With that being said, the Arkansas defense should be hitting the Horned Frogs’ offensive line hard. Anticipate a close one in Waco. The game kicks off at 7 p.m. EST. Advertisement

Timothy Everson,9/9/2016 8:00,"On Wednesday evening, the Iowa State student government passed a resolution against Brigham Young University joining the Big 12 according to an article from the Iowa State Daily.
Iowa State SGA senators state, “BYU’s discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12,” as the reason behind the resolution.
The resolution was passed 21-6 with the six senators in opposition citing freedom of speech issues.
Iowa State SGA plans on sending the resolution to the presidents of all the Big 12 Universities, including Kansas State Interim President General Richard Myers, and Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby.
The Cougars are thought to be high on the list of candidates for Big 12 expansion.
The Mormon university based out of Provo, Utah has come under fire multiple times this year for issues involving their honor code.
In April, a former BYU student reported that she was suspended from the University after reporting her rape according to a New York Times article. The reason for her suspension was for violation of the honor code after admitting to school officials that she had been coerced into an earlier sexual encounter with the same student who had raped her and that she had used LSD the night she was raped.
In August, 25 different LGBT groups signed a letter penned by Athlete Ally, a non-profit, pro-LGBT group, wrote to Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby, urging the conference not to consider BYU for expansion according to an article by Fox Sports.
BYU’s honor code specifically states: “Homosexual behavior is inappropriate and violates the Honor Code. Homosexual behavior includes not only sexual relations between members of the same sex, but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings.”

Ryan Reed,9/9/2016 8:00,"After a thrilling first week of college football that included a double overtime shootout in Austin, a three touchdown comeback in Orlando and a massive upset by South Alabama over Mississippi State in Starkville, it’s time to get ready for this week’s matchups. Here are some of the best games to look out for.
BYU vs. Utah
The Holy War is back. The Utah Utes will be hosting the Brigham Young University Cougars Saturday at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, Utah, with a kickoff time of 7:30 p.m. EST.
The Utes claim an all-time 58-34-4 record against the Cougars, but the Cougars claim that the Utes only lead 55-31-4. The reason for the difference is the Utes count six games played against Brigham Young Academy, BYU’s original name from 1875-1903, but BYU considers their first matchup to be in 1922, which BYU considers to be its inaugural season.
The Cougars come into the encounter after an 18-16 victory over the Arizona Wildcats on a last-second field goal from kicker Jake Oldroyd last weekend in Glendale. Most of the Cougars’ yards on offense came from running back Jamaal Williams, who logged 29 carries and rushed for 162 yards. The BYU defense is also a force to be reckoned with. After questions were being asked about BYU’s switch to a 4-3 defense, the Cougars responded to the critics by sacking Arizona quarterback Anu Solomon four times and had eight tackles for a loss.
The Utes head into the matchup after a 24-0 victory over Southern Utah. Despite not winning by the margin that the Utes were hoping for, there were still some positives to take away. Quarterback Troy Williams threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns. Plus, the Utah defense stuffed Southern Utah to only 158 offensive yards. Safety Marcus Williams recorded a forced fumbled, a fumble recovery and an interception. Look forward to a heated battle in Salt Lake City.
Virginia Tech vs. No. 17 Tennessee
This game could be really interesting, especially when you take the venue into consideration. Already labeled as “The Battle at Bristol,” this game will be taking place at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tennessee. The current record for attendance at a college football game is 115,109, which was set back in 2013 when Michigan hosted Notre Dame at the “Big House.” This matchup is expected to attract more than 150,000 people.
The Tennessee Volunteers enter this matchup with a series lead against the Hokies of 5-3-0. The Volunteers suffered a scare last weekend, as underdog Appalachian State managed to scrape its way into overtime, only losing 20-13. Senior quarterback Joshua Dobbs will be looking to provide better decision-making this week after his struggles against the Appalachian State pass rush. Junior running back Jalen Hurd will be anticipating a good day after his 110 yards on the ground against Appalachian State, along with the game-winning fumble recovery in the end zone.
The Virginia Tech Hokies had an ugly win themselves last weekend as they toppled the Liberty Flames 36-13. Though on paper the scoreline doesn’t look bad, the Hokies lost four fumbles to the FCS competition and only led 17-13 with 24 seconds left in the second quarter. New head coach Justin Fuente will be looking to quiet the critics as this is his first real test since taking over in Blacksburg, Virginia after Frank Beamer, Hokies coach of 29 seasons, retired.
Arkansas vs. No. 15 TCU
Despite the scary No. 15 ranking that TCU has attached to its name this week, Arkansas should have a feeling heading into Fort Worth that maybe it can pull this one off. Neither of these two sides looked convincing in their first week victories. The Arkansas Razorbacks hold a 43-23-2 series lead over the Horned Frogs but the last time these two played was all the way back in 1991, when Arkansas just edged out TCU 22-21.
The Horned Frogs are looking to improve on last week’s performance because despite winning 59-41, giving up 461 yards and 41 points to the South Dakota State Jackrabbits is outright terrible. Replacing last year’s phenom Trevone Boykin, quarterback Kenny Hill wants to continue his form from last week. Though he didn’t start too well, he finished the game with 439 yards in the air and two passing touchdowns, along with three rushing scores.
The Razorbacks narrowly edged Louisiana Tech last week, 21-20. Keon Hatcher was huge for Arkansas with his 12.7 yards per target and 85 percent success rate, finishing with six catches for 89 yards on seven attempts. However, if Arkansas wants to win this game, it needs to revive its running game. Rawleigh Williams III led the Razorbacks, producing only 96 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries with an average of 4 yards per carry. With that being said, the Arkansas defense should be hitting the Horned Frogs’ offensive line hard. Anticipate a close one in Waco. The game kicks off at 7 p.m. EST.

For unmanned aircraft systems to safely fly in increasingly crowded airspace, they must be able to accurately detect and avoid obstacles like trees, power lines, and critically, other aircraft. In efforts to safely introduce more unmanned aircraft into the skies, Virginia Tech researchers and scientists from Brigham Young University have equipped an unmanned aircraft with a newly designed radar system and optical video cameras to collect data that will help aerospace engineers develop avoidance technology. 
Mark Blanks, the director of the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership explained: “This is one of the core challenges with unmanned aircraft systems: the ability to detect and avoid other aircraft,” said . 
The Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership together with some researchers are aiming to create a database similar to ones used in computer vision research, where huge repositories of labeled images are used as test sets for visual-recognition software. In this case, the database will provide researchers with information on what potential obstacles, like a telephone pole or a small quadcopter, would look like to an aircraft’s sensors. Using two types of sensors could allow aircraft control software to assess potential hazards more accurately. 
According to vtnews.vt.edu, the researchers are analyzing and processing the sensor data from the flights, and will store the data in a publicly available database, along with the GPS coordinates corresponding to each data point — showing an obstacle’s true location as well as its sensed location. 
This data will aid the community’s understanding of the capabilities and challenges of detecting and avoiding small unmanned aircraft. 
Blanks added: “This is an exciting project, because having a readily accessible database like this will be a key enabler for development of new technology to facilitate unmanned aircraft systems integration. It will be phenomenally impactful for the future of unmanned aircraft in the national airspace.” 
Current research topics include flight beyond visual line of sight, flight operations over people, unmanned aircraft system airworthiness certification, air traffic management, remote sensing and payload development support, and airspace integration.

A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell, who specializes in ancient scripture at Utah's Brigham Young University, translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman named Helene who cared for and loved orphans.
In peace and blessing Ama Helene, a Jew, who loves the orphans, [died]. For about 60 years her path was one of mercy and blessing; on it she prospered.
""I knew the University of Utah had a collection of ancient artifacts so I made my way over to see if they had anything interesting and I remember when they pulled it out I was in shock because I immediately recognized it was Greek,"" Blumell told CNN.
""I spent the next couple of hours staring at it and started transcribing it.""
He said it took him a couple of hours to have a tough translation, which he later tweaked before publishing the findings in a report.
The document identifies the woman as Jewish, but strangely also uses a title reserved almost exclusively for Christians. ""Ama"" was a word only used for nuns and other respected Christian women in late antique Egypt.
Blumell said the epitaph is an example of one of the first times the word ""Ama"" was used before it was adopted by Christians.
It also acknowledges her age, 60, at a time when Egyptian women had a life expectancy of 25.
While there are many obituaries older than this one, Blumell said this one is still incredibly unique. He said the reference to the woman's faith and her age is what makes the translation significant.
""I've looked at hundreds of ancient Jewish epitaphs and there is nothing quite like this. This is a beautiful remembrance and tribute to this woman,"" Blumell said.
He said the writings ""pulled at his heart"" and wishes he could find out more about the woman.
""We have all these questions that we can't answer,"" he said.
For the past 27 years, the library where the epitaph was stored identified it as a coptic inscription that dated back to ""the dawn of the use of the Greek alphabet, not earlier than the second century, but not later than the third.""
Blumell's findings have been published in the Journal for the Study of Judaism in the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman Period.

#ColinKaepernickSyllabus | New Black Man in Exile
On September 4, Rebecca Martinez tweeted Louis Moore and David J. Leonard, suggesting the creation of Colin Kaepernick Syllabus. Soon, we, along with  Bijan C. Bayne, Sarah J. Jackson, and many others began the work of creating a syllabus to hopefully elevate and empower the conversations that Colin Kaepernick started when he decided to sit down in protest during an August 26, 2016 preseason game.  
Building on the framework established by Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha Blain, with their monumental #CharlestonSyllabus, Marcia Chatelain with #FergusonSyllabus and subsequent efforts from Candice Benbow with #LemonadeSyllabus and others who have sought to not only use social media and online technology to crowdsource and aggregate conversations, this syllabus represents an effort to bring  together multiple conversations, histories, disciplines, discourses, and spaces.  If we are going to follow Colin Kaepernick’s lead to have conversations and work toward justice, we must do so with the necessary tools and collective understanding.  This requires engaging multiple conversations, entering into these spaces with a historic foundation, with knowledge about the persistent realities of racial injustice and inequality, with insight into the longstanding struggles of the Black athlete.  This syllabus represents an attempt to aid in these conversations, to turn our everyday conversations, debates, and discourse into a classroom, all while making sure our institutionalized classrooms are engaged with the histories, struggles, and public discourses that shape our current moment.  
Harry Edwards recently recently wrote, “silence is evil’s greatest and most consistently dependable ally.” For all those engaged in these conversations, for those who have written, spoke about, and organized around racial injustice, silence is antithetical to our work, our ethos.  Yet, too often people speak past one another; too many people presume because of the everyday saturation of sports culture, the ubiquity of media coverage of the Colin Kaepernick, and the hypervisibility (and invisibility) of racial discourse, along with the belief that this is all about opinions and “two sides” that they are prepared for these important conversations.   
Too often, especially within the media and from those whose whiteness - their privilege - insulates, empowers, and protects, people speak without the requisite tools, without the requisite historic foundation, and without necessary information. This offers a toolbox of knowledge, links to resources, and information. The #Kaepernick syllabus furthers the efforts to disrupt the silence, to make connections, and to otherwise build on the work of Kaepernick, Edwards, members of the WNBA, Bomani Jones, Serena Williams, and so many others demanding that we speak and act.  While continuing the conversation is important, it must be done so with literacy and knowledge about American racism, the history of sports, the African American athlete, #BLM, protests, and so much more.  Discussions aren’t inherently transformative but with the requisite understanding, introspection about privilege and widely-held assumptions, and critical examination, we are better equipped as we walk toward justice and radical transformation #KapernickSyllabus #WeSitWithKaep

Klion,9/9/2016 8:29,"By Malcolm Gladwell
Last summer, the editors of Car and Driver conducted a comparison test of three sports cars, the Lotus Evora, the Chevrolet Corvette Grand Sport, and the Porsche Cayman S. The cars were taken on an extended run through mountain passes in Southern California, and from there to a race track north of Los Angeles, for precise measurements of performance and handling. The results of the road tests were then tabulated according to a twenty-one-variable, two-hundred-and-thirty-five-point rating system, based on four categories: vehicle (driver comfort, styling, fit and finish, etc.); power train (transmission, engine, and fuel economy); chassis (steering, brakes, ride, and handling); and “fun to drive.” The magazine concluded, “The range of these three cars’ driving personalities is as various as the pajama sizes of Papa Bear, Mama Bear, and Baby Bear, but a clear winner emerged nonetheless.” This was the final tally:
1. Porsche Cayman 193
2. Chevrolet Corvette 186
3. Lotus Evora 182
Car and Driver is one of the most influential editorial voices in the automotive world. When it says that it likes one car better than another, consumers and carmakers take notice. Yet when you inspect the magazine’s tabulations it is hard to figure out why Car and Driver was so sure that the Cayman is better than the Corvette and the Evora. The trouble starts with the fact that the ranking methodology Car and Driver used was essentially the same one it uses for all the vehicles it tests—from S.U.V.s to economy sedans. It’s not set up for sports cars. Exterior styling, for example, counts for four per cent of the total score. Has anyone buying a sports car ever placed so little value on how it looks? Similarly, the categories of “fun to drive” and “chassis”—which cover the subjective experience of driving the car—count for only eighty-five points out of the total of two hundred and thirty-five. That may make sense for S.U.V. buyers. But, for people interested in Porsches and Corvettes and Lotuses, the subjective experience of driving is surely what matters most. In other words, in trying to come up with a ranking that is heterogeneous—a methodology that is broad enough to cover all vehicles—Car and Driver ended up with a system that is absurdly ill-suited to some vehicles.
Suppose that Car and Driver decided to tailor its grading system just to sports cars. Clearly, styling and the driving experience ought to count for much more. So let’s make exterior styling worth twenty-five per cent, the driving experience worth fifty per cent, and the balance of the criteria worth twenty-five per cent. The final tally now looks like this:
1. Lotus Evora 205
2. Porsche Cayman 198
3. Chevrolet Corvette 192
There’s another thing funny about the Car and Driver system. Price counts only for twenty points, less than ten per cent of the total. There’s no secret why: Car and Driver is edited by auto enthusiasts. To them, the choice of a car is as important as the choice of a home or a spouse, and only a philistine would let a few dollars stand between him and the car he wants. (They leave penny-pinching to their frumpy counterparts at Consumer Reports.) But for most of us price matters, especially in a case like this, where the Corvette, as tested, costs $67,565—thirteen thousand dollars less than the Porsche, and eighteen thousand dollars less than the Lotus. Even to a car nut, that’s a lot of money. So let’s imagine that Car and Driver revised its ranking system again, giving a third of the weight to price, a third to the driving experience, and a third split equally between exterior styling and vehicle characteristics. The tally would now be:
1. Chevrolet Corvette 205
2. Lotus Evora 195
3. Porsche Cayman 195
So which is the best car?
Car and Driver’s ambition to grade every car in the world according to the same methodology would be fine if it limited itself to a single dimension. A heterogeneous ranking system works if it focusses just on, say, how much fun a car is to drive, or how good-looking it is, or how beautifully it handles. The magazine’s ambition to create a comprehensive ranking system—one that considered cars along twenty-one variables, each weighted according to a secret sauce cooked up by the editors—would also be fine, as long as the cars being compared were truly similar. It’s only when one car is thirteen thousand dollars more than another that juggling twenty-one variables starts to break down, because you’re faced with the impossible task of deciding how much a difference of that degree ought to matter. A ranking can be heterogeneous, in other words, as long as it doesn’t try to be too comprehensive. And it can be comprehensive as long as it doesn’t try to measure things that are heterogeneous. But it’s an act of real audacity when a ranking system tries to be comprehensive and heterogeneous—which is the first thing to keep in mind in any consideration of U.S. News & World Report’s annual “Best Colleges” guide.
The U.S. News rankings are run by Robert Morse, whose six-person team operates out of a small red brick office building in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, D.C. Morse is a middle-aged man with gray hair who looks like the prototypical Beltway wonk: rumpled, self-effacing, mildly preppy and sensibly shoed. His office is piled high with the statistical detritus of more than two decades of data collection. When he took on his current job, in the mid-nineteen-eighties, the college guide was little more than an item of service journalism tucked away inside U.S. News magazine. Now the weekly print magazine is defunct, but the rankings have taken on a life of their own. In the month that the 2011 rankings came out, the U.S. News Web site recorded more than ten million visitors. U.S. News has added rankings of graduate programs, law schools, business schools, medical schools, and hospitals—and Morse has become the dean of a burgeoning international rankings industry.
“In the early years, the thing that’s happening now would not have been imaginable,” Morse says. “This idea of using the rankings as a benchmark, college presidents setting a goal of ‘We’re going to rise in the U.S. News ranking,’ as proof of their management, or as proof that they’re a better school, that they’re a good president. That wasn’t on anybody’s radar. It was just for consumers.”
Over the years, Morse’s methodology has steadily evolved. In its current form, it relies on seven weighted variables:
1. Undergraduate academic reputation, 22.5 per cent
2. Graduation and freshman retention rates, 20 per cent
3. Faculty resources, 20 per cent
4. Student selectivity, 15 per cent
5. Financial resources, 10 per cent
6. Graduation rate performance, 7.5 per cent
7. Alumni giving, 5 per cent
From these variables, U.S. News generates a score for each institution on a scale of 1 to 100, where Harvard is a 100 and the University of North Carolina-Greensboro is a 22. Here is a list of the schools that finished in positions forty-one through fifty in the 2011 “National University” category:
41. Case Western Reserve, 60
41. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, 60
41. University of California-Irvine, 60
41. University of Washington, 60
45. University of Texas-Austin, 59
45. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 59
47. Penn State University-University Park, 58
47. University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 58
47. University of Miami, 58
50. Yeshiva University, 57
This ranking system looks a great deal like the Car and Driver methodology. It is heterogeneous. It doesn’t just compare U.C. Irvine, the University of Washington, the University of Texas-Austin, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Penn State, and the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign—all public institutions of roughly the same size. It aims to compare Penn State—a very large, public, land-grant university with a low tuition and an economically diverse student body, set in a rural valley in central Pennsylvania and famous for its football team—with Yeshiva University, a small, expensive, private Jewish university whose undergraduate program is set on two campuses in Manhattan (one in midtown, for the women, and one far uptown, for the men) and is definitely not famous for its football team.
The system is also comprehensive. It doesn’t simply compare schools along one dimension—the test scores of incoming freshmen, say, or academic reputation. An algorithm takes a slate of statistics on each college and transforms them into a single score: it tells us that Penn State is a better school than Yeshiva by one point. It is easy to see why the U.S. News rankings are so popular. A single score allows us to judge between entities (like Yeshiva and Penn State) that otherwise would be impossible to compare. At no point, however, do the college guides acknowledge the extraordinary difficulty of the task they have set themselves. A comprehensive, heterogeneous ranking system was a stretch for Car and Driver—and all it did was rank inanimate objects operated by a single person. The Penn State campus at University Park is a complex institution with dozens of schools and departments, four thousand faculty members, and forty-five thousand students. How on earth does anyone propose to assign a number to something like that?
The first difficulty with rankings is that it can be surprisingly hard to measure the variable you want to rank—even in cases where that variable seems perfectly objective. Consider an extreme example: suicide. Here is a ranking of suicides per hundred thousand people, by country:
1. Belarus, 35.1
2. Lithuania, 31.5
3. South Korea, 31.0
4. Kazakhstan, 26.9
5. Russia, 26.5
6. Japan, 24.4
7. Guyana, 22.9
8. Ukraine, 22.6
9. Hungary, 21.8
10. Sri Lanka, 21.6
This list looks straightforward. Yet no self-respecting epidemiologist would look at it and conclude that Belarus has the worst suicide rate in the world, and that Hungary belongs in the top ten. Measuring suicide is just too tricky. It requires someone to make a surmise about the intentions of the deceased at the time of death. In some cases, that’s easy. Maybe the victim jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge, or left a note. In most cases, though, there’s ambiguity, and different coroners and different cultures vary widely in the way they choose to interpret that ambiguity. In certain places, cause of death is determined by the police, who some believe are more likely to call an ambiguous suicide an accident. In other places, the decision is made by a physician, who may be less likely to do so. In some cultures, suicide is considered so shameful that coroners shy away from that determination, even when it’s obvious. A suicide might be called a suicide, a homicide, an accident, or left undetermined. David Phillips, a sociologist at the University of California-San Diego, has argued persuasively that a significant percentage of single-car crashes are probably suicides, and criminologists suggest that a good percentage of civilians killed by police officers are actually cases of “suicide by cop”—instances where someone deliberately provoked deadly force. The reported suicide rate, then, is almost certainly less than the actual suicide rate. But no one knows whether the relationship between those two numbers is the same in every country. And no one knows whether the proxies that we use to estimate the real suicide rate are any good.
“Many, many people who commit suicide by poison have something else wrong with them—let’s say the person has cancer—and the death of this person might be listed as primarily associated with cancer, rather than with deliberate poisoning,” Phillips says. “Any suicides in that category would be undetectable. Or it is frequently noted that Orthodox Jews have a low recorded suicide rate, as do Catholics. Well, it could be because they have this very solid community and proscriptions against suicide, or because they are unusually embarrassed by suicide and more willing to hide it. The simple answer is nobody knows whether suicide rankings are real.”
The U.S. News rankings suffer from a serious case of the suicide problem. There’s no direct way to measure the quality of an institution—how well a college manages to inform, inspire, and challenge its students. So the U.S. News algorithm relies instead on proxies for quality—and the proxies for educational quality turn out to be flimsy at best.
Take the category of “faculty resources,” which counts for twenty per cent of an institution’s score. “Research shows that the more satisfied students are about their contact with professors,” the College Guide’s explanation of the category begins, “the more they will learn and the more likely it is they will graduate.” That’s true. According to educational researchers, arguably the most important variable in a successful college education is a vague but crucial concept called student “engagement”—that is, the extent to which students immerse themselves in the intellectual and social life of their college—and a major component of engagement is the quality of a student’s contacts with faculty. As with suicide, the disagreement isn’t about what we want to measure. So what proxies does U.S. News use to measure this elusive dimension of engagement? The explanation goes on:
We use six factors from the 2009-10 academic year to assess a school’s commitment to instruction. Class size has two components, the proportion of classes with fewer than 20 students (30 percent of the faculty resources score) and the proportion with 50 or more students (10 percent of the score). Faculty salary (35 percent) is the average faculty pay, plus benefits, during the 2008-09 and 2009-10 academic years, adjusted for regional differences in the cost of living. . . . We also weigh the proportion of professors with the highest degree in their fields (15 percent), the student-faculty ratio (5 percent), and the proportion of faculty who are full time (5 percent).
This is a puzzling list. Do professors who get paid more money really take their teaching roles more seriously? And why does it matter whether a professor has the highest degree in his or her field? Salaries and degree attainment are known to be predictors of research productivity. But studies show that being oriented toward research has very little to do with being good at teaching. Almost none of the U.S. News variables, in fact, seem to be particularly effective proxies for engagement. As the educational researchers Patrick Terenzini and Ernest Pascarella concluded after analyzing twenty-six hundred reports on the effects of college on students:
After taking into account the characteristics, abilities, and backgrounds students bring with them to college, we found that how much students grow or change has only inconsistent and, perhaps in a practical sense, trivial relationships with such traditional measures of institutional “quality” as educational expenditures per student, student/faculty ratios, faculty salaries, percentage of faculty with the highest degree in their field, faculty research productivity, size of the library, [or] admissions selectivity.

The reputation score that serves as the most important variable in the U.S. News methodology—accounting for 22.5 per cent of a college’s final score—isn’t any better. Every year, the magazine sends a survey to the country’s university and college presidents, provosts, and admissions deans (along with a sampling of high-school guidance counsellors) asking them to grade all the schools in their category on a scale of one to five. Those at national universities, for example, are asked to rank all two hundred and sixty-one other national universities—and Morse says that the typical respondent grades about half of the schools in his or her category. But it’s far from clear how any one individual could have insight into that many institutions. In an article published recently in the Annals of Internal Medicine, Ashwini Sehgal analyzed U.S. News’s “Best Hospitals” rankings, which also rely heavily on reputation ratings generated by professional peers. Sehgal put together a list of objective criteria of performance—such as a hospital’s mortality rates for various surgical procedures, patient-safety rates, nursing-staffing levels, and key technologies. Then he checked to see how well those measures of performance matched each hospital’s reputation rating. The answer, he discovered, was that they didn’t. Having good outcomes doesn’t translate into being admired by other doctors. Why, after all, should a gastroenterologist at the Ochsner Medical Center, in New Orleans, have any specific insight into the performance of the gastroenterology department at Mass General, in Boston, or even, for that matter, have anything more than an anecdotal impression of the gastroenterology department down the road at some hospital in Baton Rouge?
Some years ago, similarly, a former chief justice of the Michigan supreme court, Thomas Brennan, sent a questionnaire to a hundred or so of his fellow-lawyers, asking them to rank a list of ten law schools in order of quality. “They included a good sample of the big names. Harvard. Yale. University of Michigan. And some lesser-known schools. John Marshall. Thomas Cooley,” Brennan wrote. “As I recall, they ranked Penn State’s law school right about in the middle of the pack. Maybe fifth among the ten schools listed. Of course, Penn State doesn’t have a law school.”
Those lawyers put Penn State in the middle of the pack, even though every fact they thought they knew about Penn State’s law school was an illusion, because in their minds Penn State is a middle-of-the-pack brand. (Penn State does have a law school today, by the way.) Sound judgments of educational quality have to be based on specific, hard-to-observe features. But reputational ratings are simply inferences from broad, readily observable features of an institution’s identity, such as its history, its prominence in the media, or the elegance of its architecture. They are prejudices.
And where do these kinds of reputational prejudices come from? According to Michael Bastedo, an educational sociologist at the University of Michigan who has published widely on the U.S. News methodology, “rankings drive reputation.” In other words, when U.S. News asks a university president to perform the impossible task of assessing the relative merits of dozens of institutions he knows nothing about, he relies on the only source of detailed information at his disposal that assesses the relative merits of dozens of institutions he knows nothing about: U.S. News. A school like Penn State, then, can do little to improve its position. To go higher than forty-seventh, it needs a better reputation score, and to get a better reputation score it needs to be higher than forty-seventh. The U.S. News ratings are a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Bastedo, incidentally, says that reputation ratings can sometimes work very well. It makes sense, for example, to ask professors within a field to rate others in their field: they read one another’s work, attend the same conferences, and hire one another’s graduate students, so they have real knowledge on which to base an opinion. Reputation scores can work for one-dimensional rankings, created by people with specialized knowledge. For instance, the Wall Street Journal has ranked colleges according to the opinions of corporate recruiters. Those opinions are more than a proxy. To the extent that people chose one college over another to enhance their prospects in the corporate job markets, the reputation rankings of corporate recruiters are of direct relevance. The No. 1 school in the Wall Street Journal’s corporate recruiter’s ranking, by the way, is Penn State.
For several years, Jeffrey Stake, a professor at the Indiana University law school, has run a Web site called the Ranking Game. It contains a spreadsheet loaded with statistics on every law school in the country, and allows users to pick their own criteria, assign their own weights, and construct any ranking system they want.
Stake’s intention is to demonstrate just how subjective rankings are, to show how determinations of “quality” turn on relatively arbitrary judgments about how much different variables should be weighted. For example, his site makes it easy to mimic the U.S. News rankings. All you have to do is give equal weight to “academic reputation,” “LSAT scores at the 75th percentile,” “student-faculty ratio,” and “faculty law-review publishing,” and you get a list of élite schools which looks similar to the U.S News law-school rankings:
1. University of Chicago
2. Yale University
3. Harvard University
4. Stanford University
5. Columbia University
6. Northwestern University
7. Cornell University
8. University of Pennsylvania
9. New York University
10. University of California, Berkeley
There’s something missing from that list of variables, of course: it doesn’t include price. That is one of the most distinctive features of the U.S. News methodology. Both its college rankings and its law-school rankings reward schools for devoting lots of financial resources to educating their students, but not for being affordable. Why? Morse admitted that there was no formal reason for that position. It was just a feeling. “We’re not saying that we’re measuring educational outcomes,” he explained. “We’re not saying we’re social scientists, or we’re subjecting our rankings to some peer-review process. We’re just saying we’ve made this judgment. We’re saying we’ve interviewed a lot of experts, we’ve developed these academic indicators, and we think these measures measure quality schools.”
As answers go, that’s up there with the parental “Because I said so.” But Morse is simply being honest. If we don’t understand what the right proxies for college quality are, let alone how to represent those proxies in a comprehensive, heterogeneous grading system, then our rankings are inherently arbitrary. All Morse was saying was that, on the question of price, he comes down on the Car and Driver side of things, not on the Consumer Reports side. U.S. News thinks that schools that spend a lot of money on their students are nicer than those that don’t, and that this niceness ought to be factored into the equation of desirability. Plenty of Americans agree: the campus of Vanderbilt University or Williams College is filled with students whose families are largely indifferent to the price their school charges but keenly interested in the flower beds and the spacious suites and the architecturally distinguished lecture halls those high prices make possible.
Of course, given that the rising cost of college has become a significant social problem in the United States in recent years, you can make a strong case that a school ought to be rewarded for being affordable. So suppose we go back to Stake’s ranking game, and re-rank law schools based on student-faculty ratio, L.S.A.T. scores at the seventy-fifth percentile, faculty publishing, and price, all weighted equally. The list now looks like this:
1. University of Chicago
2. Yale University
3. Harvard University
4. Stanford University
5. Northwestern University
6. Brigham Young University
7. Cornell University
8. University of Colorado
9. University of Pennsylvania
10. Columbia University
The revised ranking tells us that there are schools—like B.Y.U. and Colorado—that provide a good legal education at a decent price, and that, by choosing not to include tuition as a variable, U.S. News has effectively penalized those schools for trying to provide value for the tuition dollar. But that’s a very subtle tweak. Let’s say that value for the dollar is something we really care about. And so what we want is a three-factor ranking, counting value for the dollar at forty per cent, L.S.A.T. scores at forty per cent of the total, and faculty publishing at twenty per cent. Look at how the top ten changes:
1. University of Chicago
2. Brigham Young University
3. Harvard University
4. Yale University
5. University of Texas
6. University of Virginia
7. University of Colorado
8. University of Alabama
9. Stanford University
10. University of Pennsylvania
Welcome to the big time, Alabama!
The U.S. News rankings turn out to be full of these kinds of implicit ideological choices. One common statistic used to evaluate colleges, for example, is called “graduation rate performance,” which compares a school’s actual graduation rate with its predicted graduation rate given the socioeconomic status and the test scores of its incoming freshman class. It is a measure of the school’s efficacy: it quantifies the impact of a school’s culture and teachers and institutional support mechanisms. Tulane, given the qualifications of the students that it admits, ought to have a graduation rate of eighty-seven per cent; its actual 2009 graduation rate was seventy-three per cent. That shortfall suggests that something is amiss at Tulane.
Another common statistic for measuring college quality is “student selectivity.” This reflects variables such as how many of a college’s freshmen were in the top ten per cent of their high-school class, how high their S.A.T. scores were, and what percentage of applicants a college admits. Selectivity quantifies how accomplished students are when they first arrive on campus.
Each of these statistics matters, but for very different reasons. As a society, we probably care more about efficacy: America’s future depends on colleges that make sure the students they admit leave with an education and a degree. If you are a bright high-school senior and you’re thinking about your own future, though, you may well care more about selectivity, because that relates to the prestige of your degree.
But no institution can excel at both. The national university that ranks No. 1 in selectivity is Yale. A crucial part of what it considers its educational function is to assemble the most gifted group of freshmen it can. Because it maximizes selectivity, though, Yale will never do well on an efficacy scale. Its freshmen are so accomplished that they have a predicted graduation rate of ninety-six per cent: the highest Yale’s efficacy score could be is plus four. (It’s actually plus two.) Of the top fifty national universities in the “Best Colleges” ranking, the least selective school is Penn State. Penn State sees its educational function as serving a wide range of students. That gives it the opportunity to excel at efficacy—and it does so brilliantly. Penn State’s freshmen have an expected graduation rate of seventy-three per cent and an actual graduation rate of eighty-five per cent, for a score of plus twelve: no other school in the U.S. News top fifty comes close.
There is no right answer to how much weight a ranking system should give to these two competing values. It’s a matter of which educational model you value more—and here, once again, U.S. News makes its position clear. It gives twice as much weight to selectivity as it does to efficacy. It favors the Yale model over the Penn State model, which means that the Yales of the world will always succeed at the U.S. News rankings because the U.S. News system is designed to reward Yale-ness. By contrast, to the extent that Penn State succeeds at doing a better job of being Penn State—of attracting a diverse group of students and educating them capably—it will only do worse. Rankings are not benign. They enshrine very particular ideologies, and, at a time when American higher education is facing a crisis of accessibility and affordability, we have adopted a de-facto standard of college quality that is uninterested in both of those factors. And why? Because a group of magazine analysts in an office building in Washington, D.C., decided twenty years ago to value selectivity over efficacy, to use proxies that scarcely relate to what they’re meant to be proxies for, and to pretend that they can compare a large, diverse, low-cost land-grant university in rural Pennsylvania with a small, expensive, private Jewish university on two campuses in Manhattan.
“If you look at the top twenty schools every year, forever, they are all wealthy private universities,” Graham Spanier, the president of Penn State, told me. “Do you mean that even the most prestigious public universities in the United States, and you can take your pick of what you think they are—Berkeley, U.C.L.A., University of Michigan, University of Wisconsin, Illinois, Penn State, U.N.C.—do you mean to say that not one of those is in the top tier of institutions? It doesn’t really make sense, until you drill down into the rankings, and what do you find? What I find more than anything else is a measure of wealth: institutional wealth, how big is your endowment, what percentage of alumni are donating each year, what are your faculty salaries, how much are you spending per student. Penn State may very well be the most popular university in America—we get a hundred and fifteen thousand applications a year for admission. We serve a lot of people. Nearly a third of them are the first people in their entire family network to come to college. We have seventy-six per cent of our students receiving financial aid. There is no possibility that we could do anything here at this university to get ourselves into the top ten or twenty or thirty—except if some donor gave us billions of dollars.”
In the fall of 1913, the prominent American geographer Ellsworth Huntington sent a letter to two hundred and thirteen scholars from twenty-seven countries. “May I ask your cooperation in the preparation of a map showing the distribution of the higher elements of civilization throughout the world?” Huntington began, and he continued:
My purpose is to prepare a map which shall show the distribution of those characteristics which are generally recognized as of the highest value. I mean by this the power of initiative, the capacity for formulating new ideas and for carrying them into effect, the power of self-control, high standards of honesty and morality, the power to lead and to control other races, the capacity for disseminating ideas, and other similar qualities which will readily suggest themselves.
Each contributor was given a list of a hundred and eighty-five of the world’s regions—ranging from the Amur district of Siberia to the Kalahari Desert—with instructions to give each region a score of one to ten. The scores would then be summed and converted to a scale of one to a hundred. The rules were strict. The past could not be considered: Greece could not be given credit for its ancient glories. “If two races inhabit a given region,” Huntington specified further, “both must be considered, and the rank of the region must depend upon the average of the two.” The reputation of immigrants could be used toward the score of their country of origin, but only those of the first generation. And size and commercial significance should be held constant: the Scots should not suffer relative to, say, the English, just because they were less populous. Huntington’s respondents took on the task with the utmost seriousness. “One appreciates what a big world this is and how little one knows about it when he attempts such a task as you have set,” a respondent wrote back to Huntington. “It is a most excellent means of taking the conceit out of one.” England and Wales and the North Atlantic states of America scored a perfect hundred, with central and northwestern Germany and New England coming in at ninety-nine.
Huntington then requested from the twenty-five of his correspondents who were Americans an in-depth ranking of the constituent regions of the United States. This time, he proposed a six-point scale. Southern Alaska, in this second reckoning, was last, at 1.5, followed by Arizona and New Mexico, at 1.6.

Here's Anthony vitality and Austin gateway. Just school. It's back to school if you buy tally he went. Where you're talking go for your WPI dot com often the only question I have for you is out in the dynasty did look at Dan dance it looks dead. Differently answer that you sued they didn't think we are not exceeded what happened. I screwed up I answered the question to say it's acts. I was gently took now a cancer for those of you don't know that would be everyone not. Lots audience right now. Which is not looking too and densely populated out there it's just festive just us in here for those of you don't know we did we did. Starlet take and then the oh lead we scrapped we scrapped it aptly put a nice little prank on Clinton's answer so yet. And we tick ever she is now back billions. From we the gestured to where gunfire in sports happened was we weren't supposed to answer whether or not. The out and he was dead to you don't answer that craven practiced yet I've practiced to start ex pitcher like five minutes before we went live. And we literally went back and forth like data to answer answered are so last week to elicit gutless thank you very much we. Rambled for about 69 minutes. And send hey I didn't mean to do that lets him nauert I'm Islam. Anyway real structure today sixty podcast is six and cast. Were to go over the conferences because there were some major news conferences some were good some relief dad. We're gonna check in on that web worse bulls beat degree. Cal quarterback first degree life quarterback. That's quarterback race in the country only court records country there's it was too so we'll get into that. You have to be easier playing will go over some local stuff the local men at the Collins elementary yup one of our hopefully not. A 109 minutes or laws. I think in time is 616. Already forgetting like this exposition. Yes the missionary. We will well last week's games they'll give you next week's gains Igor picks we did well Arctic this week. I did about average when I was five and yeah. Don't for one possible that I guess which is it that good week for you yes it's great week for me now greeted Lego league for you that early in segments you know just wherever receipt. You know will come up with some here and there. Will say. You just never know it you never know segments on the fly you know the first I'll bring it back a star a podcast. Every college football season. Some thoughts and prayers and there are some upsets. There are some tough times. Close games this. Time to listen to rest. Just sad week. See I thought that we're gonna you're gonna say we start every I cast a difference. Oh and that we're gonna start each podcast. Looking at lake dead dogs. Which is great Andrea yet it's it's it really much better I don't know again. All right that's prayers this week for growth in Mississippi State the loss to scrub team a club team. And just like that it's crazy quickly college football season changes over. Because at Mississippi State ever want it to be. A top team ever want to meet the playoffs to probably done. And they're undefeated nonconference out of aren't undefeated in the doctor defeated there what was the non godly president winless in the night coverage but there isn't conference to. Also out at this point. That in its appointments to point that they go undefeated in their conference they can still make some noise that be crazy. If we're looking at the end of the season missed it BC it's like ten other conference. They were in the SEC. They are like well it did have that last applications state. Yeah that in our so. Think about Tennessee and public Butch Jones also thought tempers are board which counts now opposite thoughts and prayers I respect questions you more to catch everybody up. But Jones is officially my favorite coach in the in the Allison NFL well football period he's my favorite coach. In this sport of football. With the exception. Coached from a friend list but which jobs. Definitely 100% proven confirmed. Per sources. Voted Tennessee number line sources confirm that snake yeah now the country got Odom got from sources close to the close to what she closes source. Yet they are he voted the number one in the country in the coaches poll which is hysterical because is they're not the number one team in the country and ousted he's the only one. An innate need overtime squeaker over applications load them. Love that instills confidence in your voice number one and engages in and you and he get terror down. Any tournament I would say this though. Michigan could beat apple much seen in years back yet and broke up that game hundred times. When Tennessee was losing in Tennessee did in Tennessee did in in in good fashion here is. Were always dance world is we're sitting here were saying to Tennessee when the close game allegiance to it they just did. They just played at their team they could Whitley the Ryder Cup want to scrap the purse to cut back that's true there are down there down that contest. I think. They were they don't want to the country. Still yes they'll. That brings to Butch Jones ye that brings us to one of the segments this press. And flashing ten. It is put children Hollis coach. Yes but Jones is not a coach in the country. I refuse to. Answer your question in terms of how you interpret hi I'm just physically attractive your physically attracted to he's probably the best coach in the country period he is also distract us now. Forbes. The website in the publication. I've heard it. They're saying Houston's coach Tom Harmon. I'm in the region headline here from a Don Yeager yes bamboozled again on this finance a college football's hottest coach shows you you don't yeah. To change jobs to be successful talk about Houston's Tom Herman is Tom Herman now jumping to powered his thoughts coaches listen this here's I happen. Again I EIA. You were you sent me an article in your like look Forbes named Houston's coach I was coached and they in the country and went they think it. Herman you definitely not asking what it looks like as it once you click particularly in heaven again. He has an inning like that now he's looking. I'll give you that I'm assuming that dad he's got either a little dad Gillis an exit the dad has cut though this thing that's answer here in this picture yeah I don't get what they wouldn't. Shown experts with the caption says it is yet again it looks at why background there yet but that tipped because but he Wyatt. But around you guys see this pick and our Frontline are you would love and you get that he absolutely love it. Com. So this new ranking up there Tom German coach Jones but he won two on the list. Tough to say. I go I go which Jones one. Hugh freeze still too is up there. That Hugh freeze. Pages of dad's hero. Funeral and Annika comes out with a loss yeah we love that coach. You just you know sums up his sleep yet Obama's gonna win the championship. They're undefeated conference undefeated team in the conference under wraps all the match feasted Tom Herman I guess I guess open three I had no idea who he was before ten minutes ago that but look I am now pretty attractive dude. Houston you know. Great or gee here yeah yeah it you know so time permit threes that's my official coaches this losers segment rate the hottest coaches in need. And I go to Egypt Akashi check that aren't on the conference's. They don't want this segment number one on one yes yes the thing about cup you gotta start. We. The SEC. It's a very day. That's roughly the disease we can't tell you haven't sure well we arts are about Tennessee's week when Adam Everett's state undefeated conference. And have barely survives UCLA also needed overtime Arkansas barely survives or forget it played Mississippi State. Blues losers on this out of him still undefeated in the conference though and then listen to teams who lose who lost Kentucky Ole miss Missouri LSU Auburn all lost. Juqua nobody goes there in conference. Actually I think one. The Reid does read those up again because he tacky. They losses southern miss is not our state is and is it I think as you lost to Vanderbilt. Yeah. So yeah one conference there real sub conference when it. That's pretty good Vanderbilt Hebert to its resting in the it's easier now no better though is oh and one would that play producer play West Virginia. Exert that lets forget this is still low conference losses as anyone if she lost. Wait a minute dance let me do some research got. Ants do that in years typing away here charged. John check it out Vanderbilt lost to somebody who. It was. We do that things were we distract the list there district was just what is. It's open outlook are Carolina south Carolina's best team in the and if you're in the SEC wanted to know in the SEC got Davidson won an overall. Vanderbilt worst team in the SEC own one everybody else still undefeated so it is yep I'm gonna ask you this right now. Who is tied for last weeks yes easy. That previously had a Dicey. And it's Taylor questioned may or may not have been previous may still be current Alabama as the answered my question yeah. How many comes with that Sierra so there Tut for what place. Last Tucker last place in terms of wins they're just about the last place in terms of overall record Vanderbilt is last dance yeah we can't we count it's just count. Is he out evidence he did it could be out there double that scored more count points and there are now. That's regarded as the the worst offense it's it's all about point differential four. To forget having notes points for that points four points four points. So well they aren't there. Probably the worst team in the SEC. Least amount of points tied so big big time big twelve teams there. The dip in all seriousness the SEC did at the they had a bad weekend that are that weekend that we need it's pretty bad I couldn't when I was like as tag that out I think neither this is the event weekend but it never really. Thought about it and I take it out to you. And I was like that's they do as bad as you could yeah. And I know the play a lot of good schools and not in their non conference schedule. But there's a lot of losses a lot close wins. Oh yeah that's at Arkansas one get them to forget that play at this week when poker. Not a good team. And the recently and it checked when England won exactly and you take a for example. That some top teams in the Big Ten schedule. Wisconsin beating LSU yes that's another coach another LSU is what fifth in the country. Similar except people think that they're gonna win the SEC this year sent people want to know in the national championship team. Close that the ports they're what top teams yet and and at least Wisconsin. Be tense conference. You tend to real well. I'm looking and now they're two losses rockers. Loss to Washington. In northwestern. Who lost to. Policies or school yet as bad as it was at Los northwestern. To some teams she's studies track of enforcing. Tim loss. Assume that if she's so many. Western Michigan let's do that next week let's just go over every game. You wanna just Sione teams you can list the top let's read box schoolers. Loving every game I'd let out. And then it will preview. Every new game that happened sure. Where the power rankings fair top like fear players reached him. You will do to ridiculous that's of each box score. Make distinct attitude it podcast. Anacostia podcasts it doctor Oz 48 hours dots and it's missing work stick to bed. And it bed pretty deadly it is bad their backs gore street via owners so. Me are so let's move on exit seven number two web first wolves explained it earlier explain it last week it's the number one. Quarterback chase the number one. You know it's essentially a Eisner race. Yeah I would think web animals here at the number one number two. 118. As a last week day where the two leading passers in all it's all college football heading into this past weekend. Revolved around an effect in. And ramblings here is are in school or book yeah yeah sure does it really early look at this and we milk this what there's there's little wrench in history's Austin tell me dance which you forgot about. You use it appreciate it never knew about it and yet. There are points that the pre show email. I go by the lifting gun. Chemical Leslie. I think he's good to go next week I think he's a guy for you decide on a Tyco or have you is that easy to use our sources confirmed that again you're correct I can't confirm nor deny you'd be against my journalistic integrity. Thank you for journalists those tests continue. Little wrench thrown into this next you were so so that's jumped with. Woolsey's and you forgot about my and drew ground drew DE RU. I love it I was about I was about to dislike your brand now alone now it's a great name he took over. Like the walls weight in neck in neck cal Hawaii game and it'll likely to kids is what Obama is doing and the LSU. Yeah yeah. Michigan. It didn't web of cal they didn't play this weekend just for that game in Australia against Hawaii. If you listen last week we talked to OG RP showed you that. It's pretty much half way for human tests Australia yeah he has no less and less and Briscoe. Backed school lesson there so are you scared that. Drew brown is now on the streets and officially declare your pilot the deep red birds take wills keepers drew brown eyes. Oh yeah that's what it is an effort from this week I'll give you drew brown. Guy and go with him. See I thank goodness acutely this Alger brand is a freshman. Hello you particularly seniors job my intent out of here here's my fears they about you bring out will that affect action you finance. He came in to school this year it's played two positions gets what Baylor QB in defensive tackle can reach I'm not that that at. So what you all DTE. Let drew brown you audit manager Branson of college football you've put your best guy wherever they can play it is class. Oh yeah it's. He's not high school too AM much. It says he's their number one recruit for this year. It also says classes twice seventy says the soft is the freshman class. Act like recruiting class it's sure. Anyway so yeah. Damon. Bulls once and for thirteen eighty yards in interception of the game that the court record of one point five and oh. Quarterback is different passer rating which is different in the NFL on so what that does out of one point six so that's pretty good day if I drew brown. Had himself a 45 point once we needed about forty tons better. And it masks and even the Macs yup you also interceptions six yards five for ten. The numbers were much better he sacked weigh less yes the running back. Security if I care and I just easy just ran yes ran more than any thing is he's listed as as a quarterback. So I don't know I haven't talked to coach. And got the rundown of who's gonna start against Tennessee Martin. Which is that's a big game big game and big game OAA why is open to of that still undefeated in the conference though. There's a lot saliva though I still alive. So I'm with drew brown do you want deep web key goals. Are you up on the on the ground for now by the graduate that your current with the defensive tackle at all of this QV and runs a lot let's go to right now that is your quarterback update your highs and chase right. There they can just explain how confusing this is drew brown is listed on Hawaii's. That clubhouse page. On line is can it. He's listed as the as a 2017 recruit. And he's a sophomore. I understand it they were not what I know solution you know how likely cruising works you have Malaysia. Let's get next week with concealing pitcher Brad. I'll work on getting your brown. Or maybe the coach from hell or coach or get your grass no way we can't get the cuts should I ever tell you. I want over this I don't precipice last week I think I told you this last week. Bottom. I did some recon work this'll be. We're just we're done with that segment too vocal this one of the other. Spur of the moments and some political flash cancer that we need a sound effect of global bang boom. On average. Anyway I did some panic on. During yachts. I tried to do some recon to again. Against a high profile guest. On our show. On. Didn't work out so well so far. I forget his name off the top my head at that but the bottom players during drafts you did tell me this that I forget to us. Yet it was during the draft and Carson Wentz is the backup to Carson once. On and this guy was getting no love everyone's saying Carson Wentz. This course and one stat. EU really turnaround in north Dakota's state licensed team he did all this stuff can you believe this quarterback. This is gonna come into the NFL playing this late pretty bad school. Absent here saying OK I'll be friends with. The backup quarterback yet it let that let them yet so I am I'm going to the roster right now trying to find out. So a follow on Twitter tweet I don't know Blanche in acting too much. Any do you get any any bites I don't know flights between is that how much you're right it was the week of the drafts I think rate after the draft. And of notre NFL draft yet when he didn't participated in. I just confined. Oh here are Keaton stood stirred. Accessory in stature so. If anyone knows Keaton out there and try to get on the show's well. We do however I do the connection on Twitter is he starting is he's starting quarterback for an answer it I don't know how to unlock Sheridan check in on the they lost thirteen to nine Stony Brook. So programs got a long ways since cars and good is it could be that Brooke. We have so what's score with that is a start. He went out thirteen for 4514. Years were an option in this game is on that let's get one Asia yet we have. And he follows on what school. That's right order it's only that you did tell a reporter out there were at school with what is North Dakota yet. Reporters yet which is we're well we'll get in touch with her shall look this up with Keaton. The beer and one I guess we do of the special guest. The couple weeks. Will hold off this this is that this is actually guessed that you guys should should like you might not. My album he might be spoiler he or she it's he spoiler there. With special guest coming. For one of the big U mass games. Speaking of hassles of strict Oakland cemetery local minute let's do it that's transitions EC. You mess that was at northeastern BC you mess Giants Stadium battle obesity. If you want details just listen until every single commercial running WE Harry. Deaconess. It's recent trend that's a huge game its sponsors every trend it's a huge game as you know it's a refugee mess analysts have it we are now the US sorry you know that you were as well 08 emirate there excellent I've follow the team closely since the beginning. Guy. Since the beginning and he did this morning. Since today. Slightly before. Level. What do you know about this investment team I know that there are undefeated in and if he in the cupboards and will remain itself. Darren Bennett because they are independent which is I loved in this it's a crystal ball such a good move is there anything is there anything sneaky here and better. It then got going independence that you can finish the season undefeated in your conference. And it helps out the playoff race I think he mats has an edge on everybody it in terms of getting into the playoffs as. A non power team but is but aren't aren't are reconsidering the mass of our team they did. I'm only lose by seventeen of Florida the latter. Now I want it I would I will say this though you mess it sounds crazy but had gone undefeated Georgia here's some of the winds outta that. There go to that app Florida against PC. Against Mississippi State at south Carolina. At BYU. And in the rest of sort of push over games but that's a good schedule for you mess what's it mean yes. Obviously there are gonna go undefeated but that's the that's the difference let's go with that see the thing is if you mess is playing in the Mac. And they go undefeated. There's still much getting dressed and get a better chance opportunity. I mean the the gluten used for. But date entering this season they had like a realistic opportunity to get to a major bowl. If they went undefeated and beat three SEC schools. If that going and he is asking little much of UMass who are other way culprits that's my team. Can't. Count arts and I'm so sorry keep forgetting that you're gonna let alone conference. Conference it's a much tougher we can agree this path again that's annuity. Tequila on the air it's Griffin yeah let's get Griffin on getting behind the expert hotline Griffin Harris colony here a grip. Your lap run the podcasts had me enhance. How do you mess yet Broncos game now you mess UMass BC game coming up this this this week and he got. Yeah they got. We. Hey great well thank you very grip will drive it there if CNET. Art's great pick by. Encrypted ticks BC over UMass straight out. But he grew optical expert. Self declared. Hey is there any chance he messed beastie see this week now CU. I think. Harris C I don't think there is an all I fall in love again this as a blip on U mass in BC. I think we forget that because BC. BC's offense is so bad when they play the half decent defense. That when they play. When they don't play a half decent but their defense is really really good against the best games. So it's still gonna be really getting antsy answer it's an airlock fans can actually do stuff against bad defense Cipro we want. Allowing points to you straight. That's right it's probably be shut out electric points. Would think so at UMass is probably going to be really active for the game but we'll give you the official to clear the spread. BC did beat Howard last year seven needs six to nothing in a an ash in it could gain those only. Recorders forgot about that and then they went I think the over under was like fifty the spread or selling was 52 whatever. And Steve hit 76 and three quarters called the game. And that until it was it was full fourth quarter but to shorten the quarters but button that's what laws to play four quarters but that second half stemming course. And biggest there at the and a so no Alan Boyd not an efficient powerful game yeah desperate liberals don't think peace you know the US has any chance. I mean. Battle obesity. To a steel we hyped up they'll be hyped up for the game. The screen house this month it will be hyped up don't know how did you guys play to a stadium guys. I think him by now by my prediction I can see that covering the immediacy seventeen points out that US and its chance to in the game. I think BC is get in and go in right around seventy is can directly. I think they'll be closer and you think you're part of the temple game. These teachers the can't score. They really can't score if you hills Florida and it fluorescent much better team in DC and they were rich and that there were rats that team. And a Florida's offense stinks that's of species. Let's move on I'm getting sick of the local minute that welcome. Over let's go skiing as we mentioned a bunch of them but let's get more detail of the really good because there are a lot of this this weekend. What was hyped up to do it definitely lived. It definitely lived up. Guess it's amazing how well will get to this end this segment this week's games I'll. But I hit a spoiler alert this week's games are terrible. Last week's games this segment were currently doing so I'm able to talk about this correct. Last these games were amazing and they. And they lived up to expectations it was like it was hailed as. One of the hill by and media people like us. We call it. One of the best weak ones that are and it lived up I would say there was one game day. One high profile. Team that didn't has the Albion USC game. Which I I I don't know I usually don't work for Ehrlich the favorites. In any sport really if it's not like my local team before whatever reason I love watching out damages speed up. I would rather watch Alabama just destroy it high profile team. That play close competitive. I don't know why. Yeah I don't know why either I don't read through that I laugh I when I saw that Spiller. I laughed as collateral while and they just explode. Yet just exploded. It was so great destroyed it which they do so often. I know that for whatever reason that like arrogance of Alabama in influencing like that they could play an NFL team. It's just I like that decades built up even more so the more they win the more it's like oh I don't know. This can be the best team ever created and football. They could beat the raiders maybe it rounds like. If de LST question if they've played the browns lose the browns dynasty over. It is over it's a loss. Topix lost of just saying I Veoh worked up could they over. The best game. Was probably Texas. Texas Notre Dame is the best is yet was an insane game. What I love about week one and is. That that game can happen. But we can still all we can like. Really love this about one but it's a thing about week one we have to say. Maybe those two teams don't end up being. Bike week eight could come around in the Cuba before entry ticket booking great teams you sol it's a playoff team yet. Political votes to you okay. That's tough but it's awful I don't talk about it. Let's talk about so. When I was saying was. Both teams to be terrible flip both teams are terrible they both lose Streeter and we could just seemed to mediocre teams everybody in the country watched missile could mean there's enough game it had that crazy. How were tied at. And regulation. Yeah they went to kick extra point blocked the old the old returned two point conversion for Tim yeah I love that play. Unbelievable. Hey here's here's a news segment jerk. What do you think of college overtime. I am Stan yeah I'm a huge fan I hate I hate ever when he says. I hate everyone hate the people that say that it's a bad. Their psyches haters like 10% of the people. Don't like the college overtime I think it's gimmicky. That the I mean he gets me so that it's like the most exciting thing it's so much better than the NFL overtime. Get a photon is so bad the only way you could Blake really have a fair. Overtime and football is playing a full quarter. It didn't like to gain loss another hour. You can't you can't play a full court and in any sport you keep their stalemate it's impossible to break a tie without like somebody being pissed off. Or is basketball the possibly could even argue that it's five minutes that's so little. Yeah basketball is as close as you can get to a perfect over. Yeah that's they're culpable too because it's exciting as well as I love it I let itself much started 25 just do your thing scar. Disco I love it I love college overtime every game to go in overtime cut and run looked tears that you have to go after three scores you have to go for too. That's just such a great addition of that it's a great great little piece there. I'm that are both really happy about super ball flights there Cherie. We're sort of agreeing law. Because he's full or just started. I'm saying like am happy just to be talking about it the end is nothing like bitter about this college sees it. In the doldrums of of November or early November when it's sick like forty degrees outside in and rainy. At night yep. Wearing year we're in here as a little bit of we've been doing it every week. In the web vs bulls they're no developments in the Webber's pulls the race. My conditional pack there'll be it's Andrew Brown. You. And then we're gonna start we're back to me cheer anymore so eat this up like canned. Folks take it why can't title yet. I wanna talk about. Houston and a lot not a lasting peace and Oklahoma which I thought it was going to be the best game is on first games played. Wasn't present in the game I thought boom we just saw the best game weekend. See here's another thing. Is and maybe Oklahoma sucks that I'm the luckiest seems like a written there you go east and can be a playoff team. Maybe Oklahoma's got a good team maybe six it's every time. I don't have the stats her. Like off hand somewhere that could defaults. But every time Oklahoma is fevered early on the season they just never finish in the top. Quote me on that. I'm I don't know exact jackass that I had no way did the exact set but. I don't think they started last year. As a fever. You don't think so either I think there and I army field sort of took. The whole thing by storm I will interest you. Look at I had a pre season rankings you know was hopeful by Obama's here Oklahoma was nineteen last year. Yes it. And they finished obviously warehouse that people are saying they're gonna win the whole thing this here in with full. There BS but Jones Butch Jones knowing that it seems that team. Yeah. Let's see and try to see so Oklahoma 2014. They were the number fourteen got one. First please spokesman Butch Jones this Tennessee Kennedy. And let's see how they financed. To funnel rankings she doesn't fourteen. I don't see them anywhere on this list Syria on. It won't be the last two years. I'm right that's enough of the sample satcher me samples that are really need. Two years that's what they say it's in the biz that's what that if that's all they do need every six every analyst business or football business Craig gore junior. Looked great. Houston is a team that's put our audiences that's not Garrett their use is pushing to get into the big twelve coach like. Player and they could have with this week. Just as one win they could have done it already. Yeah they belong they do along lake. You caught me up UConn had their meeting today at least. With the big twelve really hit it Yemeni sources and birds with screeners Attica think your son on Twitter. It's. Twitter my plate days this idea Huskies to make pitch for big twelve today. Former UConn ET doesn't like chances money sources. A big journals no announcement of reveal my sources it's a Hartford current move on Google. Thanks yup got to put that out there next breaking news yes. UConn has no business being there but Houston did deserve to be there. Houston deserves to be there. Just push you simply YUN in refined. You mess though no yourself degree stay independent our boys are we radar us sneak up on everybody at the end you wanna date yet. And you can say two years here and and ask your question conference you're gonna go through giving you'll like the number one college football all time school. Is Notre Dame you think college football all time ignored in conference and then. They're trick question it's not in a country know exactly. UMass does that unity in the next Notre Dame. That's confusing his war if there enough independence that they could form their own little mini conference but they're not you can't think of the independence as a group now. It's very tricky. Web sites to global independents together in the standings because they are. Not together they are in fact independent from one another good point so they should scatter them about it in the standings page. They shouldn't even be in the standings. When you think about that strip it's our conference in outstanding. Islam but discourse that's the rankings from atop they're the rankings because that's really belong. Let's get let's get the web editor for espn.com. Get him on the show him on the show let's tackle that you know automatic for him that Antarctica. You might.

The Big Ten Conference didn't exactly challenge itself in Week 1 of the college football season, with its member schools playing nine teams ranked 120 or worse in the Sagarin ratings. But it did distinguish itself among its Power Five conference peers by winning more than any other.
Big Ten teams won 12 of the 14 games they played, and the way they did helped them stand at No. 1 in the USA TODAY Sports College Football Conference Rankings after one week.
The Southeastern Conference finished 2015 as the No. 1 league in our rankings, which are calculated based on five factors — Cody Kellner's Strength of Schedule (SoS) , the USA TODAY College Football Computer Composite (CFCC) rankings , yards per play (YPP) differential, points per game (PPG) differential and a metric created just for this rating system, Non-conference performance (see methodology below).
USA TODAY
USA TODAY Sports college football staff picks for Week 2
But the SEC's opening weekend results left it No. 3 among the 10 FBS conferences entering Week 2. Those results which included a .500 record vs. non-SEC opponents, relegating the league to fifth among 10 leagues in non-conference performance. How unusual is it for the SEC to drop six non-conference games in one weekend? It took the SEC an entire season a year ago to lose six non-conference games to Power Five schools, and its 10 non-conference losses overall were the fewest in the FBS,
It should be noted that, generally speaking, Strength of Schedule rankings for Power Five and Group of Five leagues will flip flop as the season goes on and conference play commences. At that point Power Five teams will be playing consistently stronger opponents week to week and Group of Five teams will be playing relatively weaker competition than they did at the season's inception.
Here are the conference rankings entering Week 2, by each of the five categories and overall:
1. Big Ten Conference Northwestern's home loss to Western Michigan hurt, but not enough to cost it the best standing in non-conference performance. The Big Ten's opening regimen of opponents saddled it with the seventh-worst SoS of the 10 leagues, but also is the only league with three teams in the CFCC top 10. It also scored 23 more points per game than it allowed, best of any league.
2. Big 12 Conference Big 12 offenses gained almost two yards more per play than their defenses allowed, best of any conference, and Texas' win against then-No. 9 Notre Dame helped the league withstand Iowa State's loss to FCS Northern Iowa. Though its SoS was eighth out of 10 leagues, it joined the Big Ten as one of only two leagues to score 20 points more per game than its defenses allowed.
3. Southeastern Conference Six of the 12 SEC teams that played non-conference games in Week 1 had deficits in yards per play differential (yards gained per play minus yards allowed per play), and Tennessee barely was positive in its overtime win vs. Appalachian State, gaining 4.43 per play while allowing 4.42. The SEC's yards per play differential was less than half that of the Pac-12, which had a rougher week overall. And the SEC was the only Power Five league not to have a double-digit PPG differential. In fact, it was just 3.07.
4. Atlantic Coast Conference The ACC is the only conference with two teams in the top four of the CFCC, and Florida State and Clemson's wins were the third- and fourth-best individual non-conference peformances of Week 1. So why is this fourth out of five Power Five leagues? Because beyond the Seminoles and Tigers, no ACC team beat a non-conference Power Five opponent, and only one other ACC team, North Carolina even played one. Half the league opened against FCS opposition. That will land you in 10th place in the SoS no matter what Florida State and Clemson do.
5. Pac-12 Conference The conference that came closest to dethroning the SEC in 2015 started 2016 by quietly compiling a more disappointing opening week. Yes, as usual the league challenged itself more than its peers, but the point of challenges is overcoming them. And in Week 1, only three Pac-12 teams beat a Power Five opponent. This league really needs Utah to avenge Arizona's honor against BYU, Cal to win beat Mountain West favorite San Diego State on the road, Washington State to rebound vs. Boise State and Arizona State to outscore a rising Texas Tech team. But heaven forbid USC should stumble at home vs. Utah State.
6. American Athletic Conference Houston had the best non-conference performance of the week, putting 115.61 points toward the AAC's average and helping the league rank second overall in that category. The competition that Oklahoma provided was an aberration, however, as the league's worst overall Week 1 SoS kept it from pushing the Pac-12 out of the conference top five.

7. Mid-American Conference Toledo is becoming the sneaky Group of Five team no one should want to face in non-conference play. After finishing 2015 with the best non-conference performance mark of any FBS team, the Rockets opened 2016 by dominating Sun Belt contender Arkansas State on the Red Wolves' home field. But the MAC also has to eat that opening game from Buffalo, which absorbed what was statistically the worst loss of any FBS team last week when it it fell at home to Colonial Athletic Conference member Albany.
8. Mountain West The M in MWC stands for middling after one week. The league isn't the worst in any category, but it's also not top five in any. It's the only league that can stake that unwanted claim. How can things get better? If Wyoming builds on its Week 1 triple overtime win vs. Northern Illinois, for one. And if its members can snag a few wins from a collection of Week 2 opponents that include Cal, Nebraska, UCLA, USC, Washington State and No. 21 Notre Dame.
9 (tie). Conference USA and Sun Belt These conferences finished 2015 ninth and 10th out of 10 FBS leagues, so small victories are going to be big victories. And they had two in Week 1, with Southern Miss of C-USA winning at Kentucky and South Alabama of the Sun Belt winning at Mississippi State. More glass-half-full reasoning: Though they weren't exactly facing Alabama level SEC competition, these leagues' two wins vs. SEC opponents matched the ACC for the most of any FBS conference. And they were a missed field goal in Fayetteville, Ark., and an overtime in Knoxville from doubling that total.

Methodology Strength of schedule: Strength of schedule ratings were compiled by Cody Kellner, a PhD student in Applied Technology and Performance Improvement at the University of North Texas. Kellner bases his strength of schedule measurements on the average of each opponent's individual rating that each team has played up to that point during the current season.
Each team's individual rating is a reflection of every game result of the current season as well as well as the previous season, factoring the opponent’s rating plus or minus 100 if the result is from the previous season or plus or minus 200 if the result is from the current season. The results from the previous season diminish as the current season progresses. Kellner’s model values a team's defensive performance over offensive performance. For example, shutting out an opponent 10-0 is weighted more than if a team wins 70-35. The winning team’s score is divided by the total points scored in that game, so if a winning team shuts out its opponent, the metric reads that as the winning team dominated 100% of the game.
Margin of victory is factored in, partly to allow Group of Five schools to make up for relatively weaker schedules by winning in a more decisive fashion. Location of games, injuries and conference affiliation are not considered. This is not a predictive model since it only reflects a season’s results to that point in time. In each conference, team strengths of schedule were summed and then divided to come up with an average SOS for each conference. Conference average results were ranked from highest to lowest value.
Kellner’s web site is kellnerratings.com .
Non-conference performance: Each team in the FBS and each team that played an FBS team in 2015 was given a value based on the final 2015 Sagarin ratings, whose numbers allow apples to apples comparisons of every team. Values in the 2015 data set ranged from 100.92 for Alabama to 14.02 for Savannah State. Teams were awarded or deducted points for victories based on who they defeated or lost to. For example, a non-conference win vs. Alabama (the team with the greatest value) would be worth 100.92 points. A non-conference loss to Alabama would be a -1. Similarly, a win vs. North Carolina State (the team with the 50th greatest value) would be worth 74.72 points, while a loss would be a -26.20, or the distance in the quality from the very best team in the FBS.
Bonus points were awarded for road victories against teams in the top 100 of the Sagarin ratings. A victory on the road vs. a team rated 91-100 provided a 2.5-point bonus. A road win vs. a team in the top 90 provided a 5-point bonus, and so on up to 25-point bonus for defeating a team in the Sagarin top 10.
Every non-conference result for each league was summed to come up with a positive or negative value. That value was then divided by the number of non-conference games played by that league’s respective members. The result was an average number of points earned for non-conference play by each league. Conference average results were ranked from highest to lowest value.
Computer rankings: The final 2015 rankings for every team in the USA TODAY College Football Computer Composite — a ranking of the 128 FBS schools as quantified by five former Bowl Championship Series computer formulas — were organized by conference membership, then summed and averaged. The lower the average, the better the ranking compared to other conferences.
Because Sagarin ratings are involved in the non-conference performance metric, they were omitted in this calculation. The remaining four formulas that drive the Computer Composite — Billingsley, Colley Massey and Wolfe — were included.
Points per game differential: In each conference, every team’s total points scored were summed and divided by the total number of games played. The result was average points per game scored for each league. Next, every team’s total points allowed were summed and divided by the total number of games played. The result was average points per game allowed for each league. Then average points per game allowed were subtracted from average points per game scored.
The result can be a positive or negative value — positive if a league scores more points than it allows and negative if not. Conference average results were ranked from highest to lowest value.
Yards per play differential: In each conference, every team’s total yards gained were summed and divided by the total number of plays run. The result was average yards per play for each league. Next, every team’s total yards allowed were summed and divided by the total number of plays run. The result was average yards per play allowed for each league. Then average yards per play allowed were subtracted from average yards per play gained.
The result can be a positive or negative value — positive if a league gains more yards per play than it allows and negative if not. Conference average results were ranked from highest to lowest value.

Football
Arizona State defensive coordinator Keith Patterson wasn't too complimentary of Texas Tech's offensive line, but he was very complimentary of QB Patrick Mahomes, via Arizona Sports Craig Grialou, Patterson compares Mahomes to a Hall of Fame basketball player:
“He kind of plays football like Magic Johnson played point guard,” he said, pointing out Mahomes completed passes to 17 different receivers in Texas Tech’s 69-17 season-opening win against Stephen F. Austin. “He’s big. He’ll run up in there (in the pocket) and all of a sudden you’ve got guys converging on him and whoever you left in coverage, he’ll just dump it right over your head. We have a plan to try and cast a net and keep him in, like everyone else does, but that’s easier said than done sometimes with a guy of his ability.”
RRS's Aaron Dickens recaps the head coach Kliff Kingsbury radio show, which included Kingsbury and offensive coordinator Eric Morris. Lots of good little tidbits there, including wanting to run the ball a bit more as well as the team watching the new Jason Bourne movie on Friday night in Tempe and that if he could pick any singer to sing the national anthem, it would be Rihanna and I would second that.
LAJ's Don Williams writes about the best quarterbacks ever at Texas Tech, and despite his terrific 2015 season and has some things that Mahomes would have to do to be involvedin that conversation, much of it based on his team winning a certain number of games or reaching certain milestones. For my money, Mahomes is physically the most talented and I'm comfortable saying that now.
AZ Central's Doug Haller has an extensive post practice report from Wednesday that I missed. Lots of detail about who is playing where from Arizona State's side of things.
Miscellaneous . . . Mercury News' Jon Wilner picks this week's Pac-12 games and picks Texas Tech to win . . . ESPN's Big 12 Blog Bros pick this week's games (and it appears that maybe Mitch Sherman has maybe replaced Brandon Chatmon?) and they all three pick Texas Tech, so we're all doomed . . . FOX Sports' Bruce Feldman picks a handful of games and picks Texas Tech to win . . . Football Study Hall's Bill Connelly has his week 2 picks and we're split on picks, which means that it's predicted to be a close game . . . via LGG, the Iowa State student senate is totally against BYU joining the Big 12.

golobos.com,9/9/2016 9:46,"Softball Adds Kim Reeder to Staff
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. – Head coach Erica Beach and the University of New Mexico softball is excited to announce the hiring of new assistant softball coach Kim Reeder. Reeder comes to New Mexico after spending the last two years with the Central Coast Girls Athletic Foundation.
""Kim is going to an instrumental part of our staff,"" said Beach. ""She brings a wealth of knowledge and an incredible passion for the game. She is a dynamic coach, who makes every player better and I am so happy to have her as part of the Lobo family.""
Reeder is familiar with Coach Beach's style of coaching, as she was an All-American pitcher for Beach at Ohio State from 2005-09. Reeder, who has been a pitching instructor for over 10 years, will come into the program to help out with the Lobo pitchers which will allow Beach to expand her responsibilities within the team. She has helped pitchers get to many colleges at the next level, including Santa Clara, BYU, Slippery Rock, Washington Mount Vernon Nazarene and New Mexico.
Reeder not only has a significant coaching background, but she is very well rounded in the recruiting area. Along with coaching duties at Central Coast Athletics, she was the recruiting coordinator and liaison sending players to Division I colleges, including Portland State, UNM, Western Washington, Sacramento State and Santa Clara in the last year.
Reeder spent two seasons in professional softball, playing overseas in the Italian Softball League. In 222 innings of work in the circle, she had a 1.26 earned run average.

The BYU women's volleyball team went 3-0 in the Sports Imports D.C. Koehl Classic tournament this weekend in Ohio to continue their undefeated record (6-0).
Head coach Heather Olmstead was proud of her team's effort.
""The team never gave up and everybody contributed. I'm really happy for the team,"" Olmstead said.
Tournament play began Friday morning with the Cougars facing off against Wyoming for the first time since 2010 with BYU winning 69 of the 74 times they've played in total. Veronica Jones-Perry was a stand out player during the match with 11 kills on a .276 clip.
The Cougars carried the victory momentum to their match later that evening against Long Island University Brooklyn.
BYU defeated the Blackbirds in three quick sets (25-16, 25-8, 25-13) with Jones-Perry continuing to lead BYU with 14 kills and five digs. Cosy Burnett also put up 10 kills on a .667 clip while Mary Lake contributed 13 digs.
BYU was previously undefeated against Ohio State but this match proved to be a different story. The No. 11 Buckeyes pulled ahead early in the first set then won a tightly contested second set (26-24) as well.
However, the Cougars charged back and won the third set with an incredible lead of 21-2. This set proved to be shift of momentum as Buckeyes errors continued rampant and freshman McKenna Miller put away seven kills. BYU didn't look back and won the next to sets and ultimately the tournament.

'We treated the Ohio State game like any other game,"" Lake said. ""At the beginning we we’re shaken up, a little scared and intimidated but we had to focus on the things we can control.""
Miller and Lake were key components to of the win over Ohio State. Miller had a career-high 31 kills which was the second-most all-time in one set in BYU rally-scoring history.
'I want to keep contributing how the team needs me to play, whatever I end up doing if it’s on the bench or on the court I want to get better as player and help the team grow,' Miller said.
Lake contributed a career-high 38 digs which is also the second-most all-time in the BYU rally-scoring era. Amy Boswell added a match-high 5 blocks and 13 kills. Lake and Boswell were added to the all-tournament team and Lake was named Most Valuable Player of the tournament.
The Cougars will head to face Boise State, Missouri and Idaho State in the Idaho State Invitational next weekend then take on rival University of Utah in the Deseret Duel at home on Thursday, September 15.

Nate Cunningham,9/9/2016 9:47,"Iowa State student government against BYU's potential addition to Big 12
September 8, 2016 by
The student government at Iowa State University passed a resolution on Sept. 7 formally declaring they are against BYU's potential addition to the Big 12 conference.
The resolution was introduced by Abhijit Patwa and passed 21-6. The reasoning stems mainly from the Honor Code, with the student government deciding that ""BYU's discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12.""
This isn't the first time BYU's Honor Code has been under fire since Big 12 expansion began. LBGT groups have also lobbied the Big 12 to reject BYU, feeling the Honor Code is discriminatory in nature in regards to homosexuals.
Student government president Cole Staudt opposed the resolution and released this statement on Twitter.
In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0
- ISU StuGov President (@ISUStuGovPres) September 8, 2016
BYU was named to the Big 12's shortlist of schools the conference is considering for expansion last week.
The student government's resolution will be sent to presidents of all Big 12 schools

chdsandeep,9/9/2016 10:06,"John Fitzgerald ""Jack"" Kennedy (May 29, 1917 – November 22, 1963), commonly referred to by his initials JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963. The Cuban Missile Crisis, The Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the establishment of the Peace Corps, developments in the Space Race, the building of the Berlin Wall, the Trade Expansion Act to lower tariffs, and the Civil Rights Movement all took place during his presidency. A member of the Democratic Party, his New Frontier domestic program was largely enacted as a memorial to him after his death.
Kennedy's time in office was marked by high tensions with Communist states. Kennedy increased the number of American military advisers in South Vietnam by a factor of 18 over Eisenhower. In Cuba, a failed attempt was made at the Bay of Pigs to overthrow the country's dictator Fidel Castro in April 1961. Kennedy's administration subsequently rejected plans by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate false-flag attacks on American soil in order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba. In October 1962, it was discovered Soviet ballistic missileshad been deployed in Cuba; the resulting period of unease, termed the Cuban Missile Crisis, is seen by many historians as the closest the human race has ever come to nuclear war between nuclear armed belligerents.
After military service in the United States Naval Reserve in World War II, Kennedy represented Massachusetts's 11th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1947 to 1953. He was elected subsequently to the U.S. Senate and served as the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 until 1960. Kennedy defeated Vice President, and Republican candidate, Richard Nixon in the 1960 U.S. Presidential Election. At age 43, he became the youngest elected president and the second-youngest president (afterTheodore Roosevelt, who was 42 when he became president after the assassination of William McKinley). Kennedy was also the first person born in the 20th century to serve as president. To date, Kennedy has been the only Roman Catholic president and the only president to have won a Pulitzer Prize (for his biographyProfiles in Courage).
Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested that afternoon and determined to have fired shots that hit the President from a sixth floor window of the Texas School Book Depository. Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby mortally wounded Oswald two days later in a jail corridor. The FBI and the Warren Commission officially concluded that Oswald was the lone assassin, but its report was sharply criticized. The United States House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) agreed that Oswald fired the shots that killed the president, but also concluded that Kennedy was likely assassinated as the result of a conspiracy. The majority of Americans alive at the time of the assassination: 52% to 29%, and continuing through 2013 (61% to 30%), believed that there was a conspiracy and that Oswald was not the only shooter.
Since the 1960s, information concerning Kennedy's private life has come to light, including his health problems and allegations of infidelity. Kennedy continues to rank highly in historians' polls of U.S. presidents and with the general public. His average approval rating of 70% is the highest of any president in Gallup's history of systematically measuring job approval.
Early life and education
John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born at 83 Beals Street in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917, to businessman/politician Joseph Patrick ""Joe"" Kennedy and philanthropist/socialite Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald-Kennedy. His grandfathers P. J. Kennedy and Boston Mayor John F. Fitzgerald were both Massachusetts politicians. All four of his grandparents were the children of Irish immigrants.
Kennedy had an elder brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings; Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia,Robert, Jean, and Ted. Joseph Jr. was killed in action during World War II. Robert was John's attorney general and then a senator who was assassinated in 1968 while Ted was a long-serving U.S. senator from 1962 until his death from brain cancer in 2009.
Kennedy lived in Brookline for ten years and attended the Edward Devotion School, the Noble and Greenough Lower School, and the Dexter School through 4th grade. In 1927, the Kennedy family moved to a stately twenty-room, Georgian-style mansion at 5040 Independence Avenue (across the street from Wave Hill) in the Hudson Hill neighborhood of Riverdale, Bronx, New York City. He attended the lower campus of Riverdale Country School, a private school for boys, from 5th to 7th grade. Two years later, the family moved to 294 Pondfield Road in the New York City suburb of Bronxville, New York, where Kennedy was a member of Scout Troop 2.The Kennedy family spent summers at their home in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, and Christmas and Easter holidays at their winter home in Palm Beach, Florida. In September 1930, Kennedy—then 13 years old—attended the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. In late April 1931, he required an appendectomy, after which he withdrew from Canterbury and recuperated at home.
In September 1931, Kennedy was sent to the The Choate School in Wallingford, Connecticut for 9th through 12th grade. His older brother had already been at Choate for two years and was a football player and leading student. He spent his first years at Choate in his older brother's shadow, and compensated for this with rebellious behavior which attracted a coterie. Their most notorious stunt was to explode a toilet seat with a powerful firecracker. In the ensuing chapel assembly, the strict headmaster, George St. John, brandished the toilet seat and spoke of certain ""muckers"" who would ""spit in our sea"". The defiant Kennedy took the cue and named his group ""The Muckers Club"", which included roommate and friend Kirk LeMoyne ""Lem"" Billings.
During his Choate years, Kennedy was beset by health problems that culminated with his emergency hospitalization at New Haven Hospital in 1934, where doctors thought he might have leukemia. In June 1934, he was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the ultimate diagnosis there was colitis. Kennedy graduated from Choate in June of the following year. For the school yearbook, of which he had been business manager, Kennedy was voted the ""most likely to succeed"".
In September 1935, he made his first trip abroad with his parents and his sister Kathleen to London intending to study under Harold Laski at the London School of Economics (LSE) as his older brother had done. Ill-health forced his return to America in October of that year, when he enrolled late and spent six weeks at Princeton University. He was then hospitalized for observation at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. He convalescedfurther at the Kennedy winter home in Palm Beach, then spent the spring of 1936 working as a ranch hand on the 40,000-acre (160 km) Jay Six cattle ranch outside Benson, Arizona. It is reported that ranchman Jack Speiden worked both brothers ""very hard"".
In September 1936, Kennedy enrolled at Harvard College, where he produced that year's annual ""Freshman Smoker"", called by a reviewer ""an elaborate entertainment, which included in its cast outstanding personalities of the radio, screen and sports world."" He tried out for the football, golf, and swimming teams and earned a spot on the varsity swimming team. Kennedy also sailed in the Star class and won the 1936 Nantucket Sound Star Championship. In July 1937, Kennedy sailed to France—taking his convertible—and spent ten weeks driving through Europe with Billings. In June 1938, Kennedy sailed overseas with his father and older brother to work at the American embassy in London, where his father was PresidentFranklin D. Roosevelt's U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James's.
In 1939, Kennedy toured Europe, the Soviet Union, the Balkans, and the Middle East in preparation for his Harvard senior honors thesis. He then went to Czechoslovakia and Germany before returning to London on September 1, 1939, the day that Germany invaded Poland. Two days later, the family was in the House of Commons for speeches endorsing the United Kingdom's declaration of war on Germany. Kennedy was sent as his father's representative to help with arrangements for American survivors of the SSAthenia before flying back to the U.S. from Foynes, Ireland to Port Washington, New York on his first transatlantic flight.
As an upperclassman at Harvard, Kennedy became a more serious student and developed an interest in political philosophy. In his junior year, he made theDean's List. In 1940, Kennedy completed his thesis, ""Appeasement in Munich"", about British participation in the Munich Agreement. The thesis became a bestseller under the title Why England Slept. He graduated from Harvard College cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in government, concentrating oninternational affairs, that year. Kennedy enrolled in, and audited classes at, the Stanford Graduate School of Business that fall. In early 1941, Kennedy left and helped his father write a memoir of his three years as an American ambassador, and then traveled throughout South America; including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.
On September 12, 1953, after a one-year courtship, Kennedy, then thirty-six, married 24-year-old Jacqueline Bouvier at St. Mary's Church in Newport, Rhode Island.
U.S. Navy Reserve (1941–1945)
Main article: Motor Torpedo Boat PT-109
Kennedy attempted to enter the Army's Officer Candidate School in 1940, but was medically disqualified for his chronic lower back problems. On September 24, 1941, after exercising for months to strengthen his back, and with the help of the director of the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), former naval attaché to Joseph Kennedy, he joined the United States Naval Reserve (U.S. Navy Reserve since 2005). He was commissioned an ensign on October 26, 1941, and joined the staff of the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, D.C.
In January 1942, Kennedy was assigned to the ONI field office at Headquarters, Sixth Naval District, in Charleston, South Carolina. He attended the Naval Reserve Officer Training School at Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois, from July 27 to September 27 and then voluntarily entered the Motor Torpedo Boat Squadrons Training Center in Melville, Rhode Island. On October 10, he was promoted to lieutenant junior grade. He completed his training on December 2 and was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron FOUR.
His first command was PT-101 from December 7, 1942, until February 23, 1943: It was a PT boat used for training while Kennedy was an instructor at Melville. He then led three Huckins PT boats—PT-98, PT-99, and PT-101, which were being relocated from MTBRON 4 in Melville, Rhode Island, back to Jacksonville, Florida and the new MTBRON 14 (formed February 17, 1943). During the trip south, he was hospitalized briefly in Jacksonville after diving into the cold water to unfoul a propeller. Thereafter, Kennedy was assigned duty in Panama and later in the Pacific theater, where he eventually commanded two more patrol torpedo (PT) boats.
PT-109 and PT-59
In April 1943, he was assigned to Motor Torpedo Squadron TWO. On April 24, Kennedy took command of PT-109 which was based at Tulagi Island in the Solomon Islands. On the night of August 1–2, PT-109, on its 31st mission, was performing nighttime patrols near New Georgia in the Solomon Islands with PT-162 and PT-169. Kennedy spotted a Japanese destroyer nearby and attempted to turn to attack, when PT-109 was rammed suddenly at an angle and cut in half by the destroyerAmagiri, costing two PT-109 crew members their lives. Kennedy gathered his surviving ten crew members including those injured around the wreckage, to vote on whether to ""fight or surrender"". Kennedy stated: ""There's nothing in the book about a situation like this. A lot of you men have families and some of you have children. What do you want to do? I have nothing to lose."" Shunning surrender, the men swam towards a small island three miles away. Despite re-injuring his back in the collision, Kennedy towed a badly burned crewman through the water to the island with a life jacket strap clenched between his teeth, and later to a second island, where his crew was subsequently rescued on August 8. Kennedy and Ensign Leonard Thom, his executive officer on PT-109, were both later awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for heroism and the Purple Heart Medal for injuries.
On September 1, 1943, Kennedy returned to duty and took command of a PT boat converted into a gunboat, the PT-59. In October, Kennedy was promoted to lieutenant. On November 2, PT-59, which included three former PT-109 crew members, took part with another boat in the successful rescue of 87 marines stranded on two rescue landing craft on the Warrior River at Choiseul Island which was held by the Japanese. Kennedy was relieved of his command of PT-59 on November 18 under doctor's orders and returned to the United States in early January 1944. After receiving treatment for his back injury, he was released from active duty in late 1944. Beginning in January 1945, Kennedy spent three more months recovering from his back injury at Castle Hot Springs, a resort and temporary military hospital in Arizona.
Kennedy was in Chelsea Naval Hospital from May to December 1944. On June 12, he was presented the Navy and Marine Corps Medal (the Navy's highest noncombat decoration for heroism) for his heroic actions on August 1–2, 1943, and the Purple Heart Medal for his back injury on PT-109, on August 1, 1943 (injured on August 2). After the war, Kennedy felt that the medal he had received for heroism was not a combat award and asked that he be reconsidered for the Silver Star Medal for which had been recommended initially. (His father also requested the Silver Star, which is awarded for gallantry in action, for his son). In 1950, The Department of the Navy offered Kennedy a Bronze Star Medal to recognize his meritorious service, however he would have to return his Navy and Marine Corps Medal in order to receive it. He declined the medal. In 1959, the Navy again offered him the Bronze Star. Kennedy responded, repeating his original request concerning the award. He received the same response from the Navy as he had in 1950. The Navy said his actions were a lifesaving case. Both of Kennedy's original medals are on display currently at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.
On August 12, 1944, his older brother, Joe Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed after volunteering for a special and hazardous air mission when his explosive-laden plane exploded over the English Channel.
On March 1, 1945, Kennedy was retired from the Navy Reserve on physical disability and honorably discharged with the full rank of lieutenant. When asked later how he became a war hero, Kennedy joked: ""It was easy. They cut my PT boat in half.""
Military awards
Kennedy's military decorations and awards include the Navy and Marine Corps Medal, Purple Heart Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with three "" bronze stars, and the World War II Victory Medal.
Navy and Marine Corps Medal citation
For extremely heroic conduct as Commanding Officer of Motor Torpedo Boat 109 following the collision and sinking of that vessel in the Pacific War area on August 1–2, 1943. Unmindful of personal danger, Lieutenant (then Lieutenant, Junior Grade) Kennedy unhesitatingly braved the difficulties and hazards of darkness to direct rescue operations, swimming many hours to secure aid and food after he had succeeded in getting his crew ashore. His outstanding courage, endurance and leadership contributed to the saving of several lives and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
Post-naval service
In April 1945, Kennedy's father, who was a friend of William Randolph Hearst, arranged a position for his son as a special correspondent for Hearst Newspapers; the assignment kept Kennedy's name in the public eye and ""expose[d] him to journalism as a possible career."" He worked as a correspondent that May, covering the Potsdam Conference and other events.
Congressional career
Because his eldest brother had been the family's political standard-bearer, and had been tapped by his father to seek the Presidency, his death in 1944 changed that course and the task now fell to the younger Kennedy.
U.S. House of Representatives (1947–1953)
At the urging of Kennedy's father, U.S. Representative James Michael Curley vacated his seat in the strongly Democratic 11th Congressional district in Massachusetts to become mayor of Boston in 1946. Kennedy ran for the seat, beating his Republican opponent by a large margin in November 1946. He served as a congressman for six years.
U.S. Senate (1953–1960)
In the 1952 U.S. Senate election, Kennedy defeated incumbent Republican Henry Cabot Lodge II for the Senate seat. The following year, he married Jacqueline Bouvier.
Kennedy underwent several spinal operations over the next two years. Often absent from the Senate, he was at times critically ill and received Catholic last rites. During his convalescence in 1956, he published Profiles in Courage, a book about U.S. senators who risked their careers for their personal beliefs, for which he won the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1957.Rumors that this work was co-written by his close adviser and speechwriter, Ted Sorensen, were confirmed in Sorensen's 2008 autobiography.
At the 1956 Democratic National Convention, Presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson II let the convention select the Vice Presidential nominee. Kennedy finished second in the balloting, losing to Senator Estes Kefauver of Tennessee but receiving national exposure as a result.
One of the matters demanding Kennedy's attention in the Senate was President Eisenhower's bill for the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Kennedy cast a procedural vote on this, which was considered by some as an appeasement of Southern Democratic opponents of the bill. Kennedy did vote for Title III of the act, which would have given the Attorney General powers to enjoin, but Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson agreed to let the provision die as a compromise measure. Kennedy also voted for Title IV, termed the ""Jury Trial Amendment"". Many civil rights advocates at the time criticized that vote as one which would weaken the act. A final compromise bill, which Kennedy supported, was passed in September 1957.
In 1958, Kennedy was re-elected to a second term in the Senate, defeating his Republican opponent, Boston lawyer Vincent J. Celeste, by a wide margin. It was during his re-election campaign that Kennedy's press secretary at the time, Robert E. Thompson, put together a film entitled The U.S. Senator John F. Kennedy Story, which exhibited a day in the life of the Senator and showcased his family life as well as the inner workings of his office. It was the most comprehensive film produced about Kennedy up to that time.
While Kennedy's father was a strong supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy, McCarthy was also a friend of the Kennedy family. As well, Bobby Kennedy worked for McCarthy's subcommittee, and McCarthy dated Kennedy sister Patricia. In 1954, the Senate voted to censure McCarthy and Kennedy drafted a speech supporting the censure. However, it was not delivered because Kennedy was hospitalized at the time. The speech had the potential of putting Kennedy in the position of participating procedurally by ""pairing"" his vote against that of another senator. Although Kennedy never indicated how he would have voted, the episode damaged his support among members of the liberalcommunity, including Eleanor Roosevelt, in the 1956 and 1960 elections.
1960 presidential election
Main article: United States presidential election, 1960
On January 2, 1960, Kennedy initiated his campaign for president in the Democratic primary election, where he faced challenges from Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota and Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Kennedy defeated Humphrey in Wisconsin and West Virginia, Morse in Maryland and Oregon, as well as token opposition (often write-in candidates) in New Hampshire, Indiana, and Nebraska.
Kennedy visited a coal mine in West Virginia. Most miners and others in that predominantly conservative, Protestantstate were quite wary of Kennedy's Roman Catholicism. His victory in West Virginia confirmed his broad popular appeal.
At the Democratic Convention, he gave his well-known ""New Frontier"" speech, saying: ""For the problems are not all solved and the battles are not all won—and we stand today on the edge of a New Frontier.... But the New Frontier of which I speak is not a set of promises—it is a set of challenges. It sums up not what I intend to offer the American people, but what I intend to ask of them.""
With Humphrey and Morse eliminated, Kennedy's main opponent at the Los Angeles convention was Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas. Kennedy overcame this formal challenge, as well as informal ones from Adlai Stevenson (the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956), Stuart Symington, and severalfavorite sons, and on July 13, the Democratic convention nominated Kennedy as its candidate. Kennedy asked Johnson to be his vice presidential candidate, despite opposition from many liberal delegates and Kennedy's own staff, including his brother Bobby.
Kennedy needed Johnson's strength in the South to win what was considered likely to be the closest election since1916. Major issues included how to get the economy moving again, Kennedy's Roman Catholicism, Cuba, and whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the U.S. To address fears that his being Catholic would impact his decision-making, he famously told the Greater Houston Ministerial Association on September 12, 1960: ""I am not the Catholic candidate for president. I am the Democratic Party candidate for president who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters – and the Church does not speak for me."" Kennedy questioned rhetorically whether one-quarter of Americans were relegated to second-class citizenship just because they were Catholic, and once stated that: ""No one asked me my religion [serving the Navy] in the South Pacific.""
In September and October, Kennedy appeared with vice president and Republican candidate Richard Nixon in the first televised U.S. presidential debates in U.S. history. During these programs, Nixon, with a sore, injured leg and his ""five o'clock shadow"", was perspiring and looked tense and uncomfortable, while Kennedy, choosing to avail himself of makeup services, appeared relaxed, leading the huge television audience to favor him as the winner. Radio listeners either thought that Nixon had won or that the debates were a draw. The debates are now considered a milestone in American political history—the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics.
Kennedy's campaign gained momentum after the first debate, and he pulled slightly ahead of Nixon in most polls. On November 8, Kennedy defeated Nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century. In the national popular vote, Kennedy led Nixon by just two-tenths of one percent (49.7% to 49.5%), while in the Electoral College, he won 303 votes to Nixon's 219 (269 were needed to win).
Fourteen electors from Mississippi and Alabama refused to support Kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement; they voted for Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia, as did an elector from Oklahoma. Kennedy was the youngest man elected president, succeeding Eisenhower, who was then the oldest (Ronald Reagan surpassed Eisenhower as the oldest president in 1981).
Presidency (1961–1963)
John F. Kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on January 20, 1961. In his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all Americans to be active citizens, famously saying: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" He asked the nations of the world to join together to fight what he called the ""common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.""
He added:
All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days. Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet. But let us begin."" In closing, he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism: ""Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you.
The address reflected Kennedy's confidence that his administration would chart an historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs. The contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration.
Kennedy brought to the White House a contrast in organization compared to the decision-making structure of former-General Eisenhower; and he wasted no time in scrapping Eisenhower's methods. Kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president. He was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment. He selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet. ""We can learn our jobs together"", he stated.
Much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes, Kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge. This was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the House Rules Committee in order to give the Democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda. Kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration, and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering of deeper meanings. Deputy National Security Advisor Walt Whitman Rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism, and Kennedy abruptly cut him off, asking, ""What do you want me to do about that today?""
Kennedy approved Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's controversial decision to award the contract for the F-111 TFX (Tactical Fighter Experimental) fighter-bomber to General Dynamics (the choice of the civilian Defense department) over Boeing (the choice of the military). At the request of Senator Henry Jackson, Senator John McClellan held 46 days of mostly closed-door hearings before the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations investigating the TFX contract from February to November 1963.
Foreign policy
Main article: Foreign policy of the John F. Kennedy administration
President Kennedy's foreign policy was dominated by American confrontations with the Soviet Union, manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the Cold War. In 1961, Kennedy anxiously anticipated a summit with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev. He started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine Khrushchev speech on Cold War confrontation in early 1961. The speech was intended for domestic audiences in the Soviet Union, but Kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge. His mistake helped raise tensions going into theVienna Summit of June 1961.
On the way to the summit, Kennedy stopped in Paris to meet Charles de Gaulle, who advised him to ignore Khrushchev's abrasive style. The French president feared the United States' presumed influence in Europe. Nevertheless, de Gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family. Kennedy picked up on this in his speech in Paris, saying that he would be remembered as ""the man who accompanied Jackie Kennedy to Paris.""
On June 4, 1961, the president met with Khrushchev in Vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him, despite the warnings he had received. Khrushchev, for his part, was impressed with the president's intelligence, but thought him weak. Kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to Khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them, a proposed treaty between Moscow and East Berlin. He made it clear that any such treaty which interfered with U.S access rights in West Berlin would be regarded as an act of war.
Shortly after the president returned home, the U.S.S.R. announced its intention to sign a treaty with East Berlin, abrogating any third-party occupation rights in either sector of the city. Kennedy, depressed and angry, assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war, which he personally thought had a one-in-five chance of occurring.
In the weeks immediately after the Vienna summit, more than 20,000 people fled from East Berlin to the western sector in reaction to statements from the USSR. Kennedy began intensive meetings on the Berlin issue, where Dean Acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside NATO allies. In a July 1961 speech, Kennedy announced his decision to add $3.25 billion to the defense budget, along with over 200,000 additional troops, stating that an attack on West Berlin would be taken as an attack on the U.S. The speech received an 85% approval rating.
The following month, the Soviet Union and East Berlin began blocking any further passage of East Berliners into West Berlin and erected barbed wire fences across the city, which were quickly upgraded to the Berlin Wall. Kennedy's initial reaction was to ignore this, as long as free access from West to East Berlin continued. This course was altered when it was learned that West Berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the United States. Kennedy sent Vice President Johnson, along with a host of military personnel, in convoy through West Germany, including Soviet-armed checkpoints, to demonstrate the continued commitment of the U.S. to West Berlin.
Kennedy gave a speech at Saint Anselm College on May 5, 1960, regarding America's conduct in the emerging Cold War. The address detailed how American foreign policy should be conducted towards African nations, noting a hint of support for modern African nationalism by saying that: ""For we, too, founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule.""
Cuba and the Bay of Pigs Invasion
Main article: Bay of Pigs Invasion
The prior Eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba. The plan, led by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), with help from the U.S. military, was for an invasion of Cuba by a counter-revolutionary insurgency composed of U.S.-trained, anti-Castro Cuban exiles led by CIA paramilitary officers. The intention was to invade Cuba and instigate an uprising among the Cuban people in hopes of removing Castro from power.
On April 17, 1961, Kennedy ordered what became known as the Bay of Pigs Invasion: 1,500 U.S.-trained Cubans, called Brigade 2506, landed on the island. No U.S. air support was provided. Allen Dulles, director of the CIA, later stated that they thought the president would authorize any action required for success once the troops were on the ground.
By April 19, 1961, the Cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles, and Kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1,189 survivors. After twenty months, Cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for $53 million worth of food and medicine. The incident made Castro wary of the U.S. and led him to believe that another invasion would occur.
According to biographer Richard Reeves, Kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations. When it failed, he was c",http://gravatar.com/chdsandeep,http://presidentresult.com/,en,FALSE,0,0,Automattic,Negative,,,,,,,,,,,,0,0

the Ames Tribune,9/9/2016 10:15,"The future is now at Georgia.
True freshman Jacob Eason has been tapped by Bulldogs head coach Kirby Smart to start at quarterback this Saturday against Nicholls State, according to a report from the Atlantic Journal Constitution's DawgNation .
Eason, a five-star recruit from the state of Washington at this time a year ago, did not start in the team's opening 33-24 win over North Carolina but performed well in limited playing time. He finished 8-of-12 for 131 yards and a touchdown after coming in to replace senior starter Greyson Lambert.
The move to go with Eason is one that many Bulldogs fans have been pining for ever since he enrolled in January as the top pro-style quarterback prospect in the class of 2016. He will become the first true freshman signal-caller to start for Georgia since former No. 1 overall pick Matthew Stafford took the first snaps for the Bulldogs back in 2006.
Georgia moved to No. 9 in the AP Top 25 after their win over the Tar Heels.
Smart opting to start Eason against Nicholls State gives the freshman a chance to show what he can do under center before a season-defining stretch for Georgia over the next three weeks that includes trips to Missouri and Ole Miss before hosting SEC East division favorite Tennessee.

Adding injury to the insult of Alabama's 52-6 destruction last Saturday, USC has announced that the program will be without starting center Toa Lobendahn for the rest of the season.
Head coach Clay Helton confirmed after the Trojans' practice on Thursday that the junior offensive lineman tore his ACL and MCL in the opener. Lobendahn started every game as a true freshman for USC but was sidelined halfway through the 2015 campaign with a similar knee injury.
Lobendahn sustained a knee injury on the second series against Alabama, but stayed in. He had surgery today. It was successful, Helton said.
Redshirt junior Nico Falah will take over at center for USC after backing up a number of positions along the line during his career and making one start. The Trojans boasted one of the best offensive lines in the country coming into the 2016 season but looked overmatched against Alabama's defensive front in the opener at AT&T Stadium.
The reshuffling along the offensive line as a result of the injury will be tested right away as the Trojans will play Utah State on Saturday for their home opener before beginning Pac-12 play with road trips to Stanford and Utah.
Mark Richt's return to his alma mater Miami has gotten off to a good start on the scoreboard thanks to a season opening 70-3 win over Florida A&M. In the injury department however, things have been anything but smooth sailing for the veteran head coach.
The school confirmed reports on Thursday night with a release stating that two defenders would be sidelined for the Hurricanes' game against Florida Atlantic, with starting cornerback Adrian Colbert and backup defensive tackle Adrian Colbert both suffering from what were officially labeled ""lower extremity injuries.""
The Palm Beach Post reported that Colbert suffered his injury during practice on Wednesday and tore the meniscus in his knee. The  Post also reported that Jenkins , who was hurt late in the season opener, underwent a minor surgery to fix the same issue.
The pair adds to a long list of players who will find themselves on the sideline this week against the Owls. As a result of the two latest injuries, the already shaky Miami defense appears as though it will get even younger and more inexperienced. The team started three true freshman linebackers in Week 1 and will likely have a mix of freshmen and sophomores starting in the secondary next to veteran Corn Elder.
It may not matter much for the Hurricanes this week against local rival FAU but a trip to face Appalachian State in Week 3 looms before starting ACC play in October. Dealing with a host of injuries is probably not what Richt scripted to begin the 2016 season.
Another week, another twist in the drama surrounding Big 12 expansion.
The latest move was made Wednesday night on the subject from an unlikely source: Iowa State's student government, which passed a resolution opposing BYU joining the Big 12 Conference.
'Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed,"" the group said in an official statement  obtained by the Ames Tribune . ""The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.'
The resolution will reportedly be sent to the presidents all every Big 12 school in addition to conference commissioner Bob Bowlsby.
BYU's honor code has been one of the chief sticking points surrounding the school's candidacy to join the Big 12 and a subject that has received quite a bit of attention ever since the league announced it was looking at expansion. The school, which is privately owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has been criticized heavily over the years regarding sections of the code that prohibits homosexual behavior, among other things. National  LGBT advocacy groups have already sent letters to the Big 12 conference office urging them to avoid inviting the Cougars because of the school's stances but Wednesday's resolution by ISU's student government appears to be the first - and so far loudest - message made against BYU by one of the conference's current members.
Big 12 leaders are reportedly meeting with school officials from a group of roughly 10 finalists this week in Dallas. While it has not been made public when BYU will present their case, it appears likely that the thorny issue surrounding the honor code will play a key role as to whether the Cougars are ultimately invited to join the conference or if they will remain an independent school in football.
It's doubtful that a student government resolution would be enough to truly derail the otherwise strong case BYU has to join the Big 12 but, given all of the twists and turns that have already happened with conference expansion, stranger things have happened.
If you're a fan of Mike Gundy's business-in-the-front-party-in-the-back look, has Oklahoma State got a deal for you.
The Cowboys head coach caused quite the stir back in July as he debuted his latest ""mullet"" at the Big 12 Media Days to much fanfare.  While it isn't remotely the equal of the one he sported as a quarterback in Stillwater, it's still something not normally seen atop the head of an FbS head coach.
It's also something that's turned into a money-making venture for the university as OSU athletics' online store, as pointed out by Kyle Fredrickson of the Oklahoman, is selling shirts with Gundy's mulleted silhouette in profile emblazoned on them.
The short-sleeved t-shirts sell for $24.99 , the long-sleeved version shown above for $27.99 .  Get 'em while you can, if you're into such things.
That being said, what Gundy was wearing was not a mullet.  Sure, it's business in the front, but more like a casual shindig in the back.  Don't believe me?
"" It’s not a real mullet ,' Gundy said back in mid-July. 'A real mullet has to be at least shoulder length and you’ve got to have some curls in it.""
And, if anyone would know what's a mullet and what isn't, it's definitely Gundy.

the Ames Tribune,9/9/2016 10:15,"Another week, another twist in the drama surrounding Big 12 expansion.
The latest move was made Wednesday night on the subject from an unlikely source: Iowa State's student government, which passed a resolution opposing BYU joining the Big 12 Conference.
'Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed,"" the group said in an official statement  obtained by the Ames Tribune . ""The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.'
The resolution will reportedly be sent to the presidents all every Big 12 school in addition to conference commissioner Bob Bowlsby.
BYU's honor code has been one of the chief sticking points surrounding the school's candidacy to join the Big 12 and a subject that has received quite a bit of attention ever since the league announced it was looking at expansion. The school, which is privately owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has been criticized heavily over the years regarding sections of the code that prohibits homosexual behavior, among other things. National  LGBT advocacy groups have already sent letters to the Big 12 conference office urging them to avoid inviting the Cougars because of the school's stances but Wednesday's resolution by ISU's student government appears to be the first - and so far loudest - message made against BYU by one of the conference's current members.

Adding injury to the insult of Alabama's 52-6 destruction last Saturday, USC has announced that the program will be without starting center Toa Lobendahn for the rest of the season.
Head coach Clay Helton confirmed after the Trojans' practice on Thursday that the junior offensive lineman tore his ACL and MCL in the opener. Lobendahn started every game as a true freshman for USC but was sidelined halfway through the 2015 campaign with a similar knee injury.
Lobendahn sustained a knee injury on the second series against Alabama, but stayed in. He had surgery today. It was successful, Helton said.
Redshirt junior Nico Falah will take over at center for USC after backing up a number of positions along the line during his career and making one start. The Trojans boasted one of the best offensive lines in the country coming into the 2016 season but looked overmatched against Alabama's defensive front in the opener at AT&T Stadium.
The reshuffling along the offensive line as a result of the injury will be tested right away as the Trojans will play Utah State on Saturday for their home opener before beginning Pac-12 play with road trips to Stanford and Utah.
The future is now at Georgia.
True freshman Jacob Eason has been tapped by Bulldogs head coach Kirby Smart to start at quarterback this Saturday against Nicholls State, according to a report from the Atlantic Journal Constitution's DawgNation .
Eason, a five-star recruit from the state of Washington at this time a year ago, did not start in the team's opening 33-24 win over North Carolina but performed well in limited playing time. He finished 8-of-12 for 131 yards and a touchdown after coming in to replace senior starter Greyson Lambert.
The move to go with Eason is one that many Bulldogs fans have been pining for ever since he enrolled in January as the top pro-style quarterback prospect in the class of 2016. He will become the first true freshman signal-caller to start for Georgia since former No. 1 overall pick Matthew Stafford took the first snaps for the Bulldogs back in 2006.
Georgia moved to No. 9 in the AP Top 25 after their win over the Tar Heels.
Smart opting to start Eason against Nicholls State gives the freshman a chance to show what he can do under center before a season-defining stretch for Georgia over the next three weeks that includes trips to Missouri and Ole Miss before hosting SEC East division favorite Tennessee.
Mark Richt's return to his alma mater Miami has gotten off to a good start on the scoreboard thanks to a season opening 70-3 win over Florida A&M. In the injury department however, things have been anything but smooth sailing for the veteran head coach.
The school confirmed reports on Thursday night with a release stating that two defenders would be sidelined for the Hurricanes' game against Florida Atlantic, with starting cornerback Adrian Colbert and backup defensive tackle Adrian Colbert both suffering from what were officially labeled ""lower extremity injuries.""
The Palm Beach Post reported that Colbert suffered his injury during practice on Wednesday and tore the meniscus in his knee. The  Post also reported that Jenkins , who was hurt late in the season opener, underwent a minor surgery to fix the same issue.
The pair adds to a long list of players who will find themselves on the sideline this week against the Owls. As a result of the two latest injuries, the already shaky Miami defense appears as though it will get even younger and more inexperienced. The team started three true freshman linebackers in Week 1 and will likely have a mix of freshmen and sophomores starting in the secondary next to veteran Corn Elder.
It may not matter much for the Hurricanes this week against local rival FAU but a trip to face Appalachian State in Week 3 looms before starting ACC play in October. Dealing with a host of injuries is probably not what Richt scripted to begin the 2016 season.

Richard N. Williams,9/9/2016 11:00,"
September 9th, 2016 
A rigorous new report finds that very little of contemporary “knowledge” in the area of human sexuality and gender is actually supported by strong scientific evidence. 
The Fall 2016 edition of The New Atlantis: A Journal of Technology and Society consists of a careful analytical review of the scientific literature available across various disciplines on the topic of human sexuality and gender. The authors, Lawrence S. Mayer and Paul R. McHugh, are senior scholars with impeccable credentials and qualifications to undertake a major report such as this. The report takes a careful look at the literature and decides in an informed and straightforward way what the available science does and does not say—or, more precisely, what conclusions current science does or does not justify—about these important aspects of our humanity. 
Any reader will note that the report takes up some issues that lie close to the heart of contemporary discourse about sexual orientation and gender identity. Cynical critics will probably try to dismiss it based on supposed ulterior motives. However, if the topics covered by the report are, in fact, areas where science has been co-opted by politics, and where scientists, and laymen, have overreached in making conclusions and invoking the authority of science, then these are precisely the areas where sound, careful, rigorous scientific response is necessary. As Mayer and McHugh write: 
When the research touches on controversial themes, it is particularly important to be clear about precisely what science has and has not shown. For complex, complicated questions concerning the nature of human sexuality, there exists at best provisional scientific consensus; much remains unknown, as sexuality is an immensely complex part of human life that defies our attempts at defining all its aspects and studying them with precision. 
Good scientists follow the data where they lead. They are constantly open to alternatives and remain mindful of scientific and intellectual rigor. To dismiss this scientific report as merely political is to misread it—not only cynically but unscientifically. The report, with its substantial body of analyses and findings, stands on its own ground, and it certainly provides sufficient material for study and response by serious investigators. Even serious cynics have a responsibility to deal with the data. 
Key Findings 
It’s worth reading the report in full. Here I begin by summarizing four of its principal findings. Based on the data presented by hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific studies, the report concludes: 
1. Claims that sexual orientation is immutably determined by biology are not supported by scientific evidence. 
2. Claims that gender identity is somehow fixed and innate, yet is also independent of biological sex, are likewise not supported by scientific evidence. 
3. Since the great majority of children who experience some gender-atypical thoughts do not continue to do so after adolescence, encouraging such children to become transgender or seek invasive and sometimes drastic and irreversible medical procedures is not supported by scientific evidence. 
4. The finding that non-heterosexual and transgender individuals have higher rates of mental health problems is supported by scientific evidence, while the common attribution of such findings to the effects of social stigma or stress as the only or primary cause is not supported by scientific data. 
As the authors note, some questions relevant to sexuality and gender have lent themselves more readily to empirical study than others. One such finding, which is of great concern to the authors, is that sexual minorities “show higher rates of depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and suicide compared to the general population.” The most common explanation, known as the “social stress model,” is that such outcomes are caused by the stigmatization and discrimination experienced by these individuals. Although this theory has great cultural currency, Mayer and McHugh conclude that “science has not shown that these factors alone account for the entirety, or even a majority of the health disparity between non-heterosexual and transgender subpopulations and the general population.” 
With respect to questions of gender identification and biological sex, the authors conclude: 
In reviewing the scientific literature, we find that almost nothing is well understood when we seek biological explanations for what causes some individuals to state that their gender does not match their biological sex. 
Nevertheless, the authors note, “despite scientific uncertainty, drastic interventions are prescribed and delivered to patients.” They find it particularly troubling “when the patients receiving these interventions are children.” Based on the lack of data on long-term consequences of these interventions, Mayer and McHugh strongly recommend caution when it comes to practices such as gender reassignment surgery and hormone therapy. 
Science Requires Critical, Rigorous Self-Examination 
In their conclusion, the authors call for more and better-quality scientific research in all areas taken up in the report. They also reiterate the value of the sort of scientific endeavor of which the report is a good example. They are aware that their report provides both critique and challenge to the “born that way” paradigm for understanding sexuality. As they point out, such a careful critique and challenge “enables us to ask important questions about sexuality, sexual behaviors, gender, and individual and social goods in a different light.” At present, however, there is undeniably “a great chasm between much of the public discourse and what science has shown.” 
The overall message of the report is that very few claims and very little of contemporary “knowledge” in the area of human sexuality and gender are actually supported by strong scientific evidence. I must say that I was not surprised by this conclusion. I learned in my graduate training more than three decades ago that social relevance can be intoxicating for social scientists; even a whiff of the possibility of social relevance can be irresistible. Unfortunately, the social science disciplines have never been given to fits of critical and rigorous self-examination. This new report suggests that the same may be true of some practitioners of the hard sciences as well. 
There are three principal reasons I was not surprised at the findings and conclusions of the Special Report . These are also principal reasons for which this is a very important report and deserves careful study and broad dissemination. The first reason comes from a rather well-documented contemporary controversy within the social sciences: the need for replication. The other two reasons are more philosophical, although I am not a philosopher by training: the relationship of the physical with the non-physical and the question of biological determinism. These issues are related to the nature of science itself—and to the question of what it means to be a human being. 
The Replication Crisis 
In recent years, both academic and clinical psychologists have begun to give much anxious attention to “The Replication Crisis.” Put simply, researchers have discovered that the successful replication rate for social scientific studies is alarmingly low. This is troubling, given that reproducibility has always been a touchstone for scientific rigor. Over and over, Mayer and McHugh note that careful examination of the scientific evidence shows inconsistent findings, failures to replicate data, and conflicting results. 
The great historian of psychology, Sigmund Koch, observed as early as 1959 that psychology was unique among the sciences in that it essentially chose its methods before settling on its questions. Given that its methods were adopted from the natural sciences and its questions from the human world, the “fit” between the detached methodology of the social sciences and phenomena as subtle, engaging, and deeply meaningful as sexual feelings and behaviors is simply not easy or obvious. 
What is clear is this: the commonly cited conclusions regarding the biological causality and fixedness of sexual orientation, and the social stress hypothesis, have been too facile. It is telling that those areas where the scientific research is clearest and most consistent are those areas that most straightforwardly lend themselves to empirical study, for example, in relationships between sexual practices and measurable medical and psychological health issues. I agree with Mayer and McHugh that much more and much better research needs to be conducted in this important area. 
Can Physical Things Cause Non-Physical Phenomena? 
The fundamental reason these findings are not surprising is that there is not—nor has there ever been—any explanation for how such subtle, complex, socially relevant, purposeful psychological phenomena ( non-physical things) could possibly arise from or originate in the body (a physical thing). Likewise, I am not aware of any instance in which a particular, meaningful, purposive bit of behavior has been shown to be produced by a particular physical biological substance or structure. What is usually demonstrated is that some sort of abnormality of the nervous system or brain impedes what would otherwise be a particular, meaningful, purposive behavior. But prevention is not causality, and the logic simply does not hold that if a damaged physical structure impedes a particular behavior, then a healthy physical structure can be assumed to produce the corresponding healthy behavior. Scientific evidence also shows that when I am doing something, so is my brain; however, demonstrating that a healthy brain is always involved in my meaningful purposive behaviors does not constitute evidence that those behaviors (or feelings) are produced by the brain. It is true that when the brain stops working, thinking stops. It is also true that when the liver and lungs stop working, thinking stops. We think with our brains; our brains do not think. 
Therefore, it is not surprising that science has not provided evidence that sexual orientation or gender identity have a biological cause and fixed nature. There is simply no conceptual or philosophical reason to expect that that should or could be the case. In this light, it is clear why the report finds that scientific methods have been most effective in those areas where the data are clearly empirical and there are no claims of causality between two separate ontological realms—the psychological and the physical. The clearest positive scientific findings in the report deal with the relationship between phenomena related to sexually relevant feelings and behaviors, and clinically relevant mental-health feelings and behaviors. 
The presumption that any aspect of meaningful human sexuality—above the level of simple biological functionality—should have its origin in the biological substrate comes from a metaphysical commitment, not from science. Such a metaphysical commitment to some form of reductive or emergent materialist naturalism is not required by science qua science, which only requires order in the universe and the capacity within the scientist for observing and making sense of that order. The naturalist assumption is thus not necessary for science, but it is a foundational assumption of scientism . 
Biological Determinism Makes Life Meaningless 
The report shows that there is little scientific evidence supporting the view of sexuality and gender that has come to pervade our culture. I would even go so far as to say that this scientifically unsupported view is intellectually incoherent. It renders sexuality and gender essentially meaningless. To the extent that sexual motivation, attraction, and behavior are biologically fixed, they lose their meaning. If my sexual motivation, attraction, and purpose are immutably determined by my biology, then so must be my ability to do anything about them, including to act on them or refrain from acting. This would have troubling consequences when it comes to issues such as rape or sexual assault. For why should we believe that an orientation or an attraction might be biologically determined while an inclination, desire, or action is not? 
And if orientation, attraction, desire, and even action are biologically given, on what basis could we say that pleasure is not? If sexual phenomena are fixed by biology, when it comes to feeling enjoyment or love during sex, I am not really joyful or in love—at least not in the sense that joy or love is anything more than a biochemical reaction. 
In the end, trying to understand sexual phenomena in terms of biological determination renders them meaningless. Meaning requires an agentive participation in the phenomena. Our agentive nature operates at the heart of human sexuality, much as it operates at the heart of other meaningful human experience. At times, this takes the form of a consciously deliberated rational choice that brings moral meaning and purpose to our lives. At other times, our agentive being will manifest itself more as a “giving ourselves over to,” or a “taking on” of meaningful possibilities. In such choices and actions, we find our humanity. 
Clearly, common cultural beliefs about sexuality and gender are wrapped up in a problematic, incoherent, and internally inconsistent understanding of what it means to be a human being. On the basis of Mayer and McHugh's report, we may fairly conclude that a fundamental reexamination of how we think about sexuality and gender is in order. Perhaps we ought to reexamine our vision of the human person as well. 
Mayer and McHugh’s new report is an important document. It clarifies the state of scientific knowledge in a most important and culturally weighty area. It is thorough, unbiased, and straightforward. I hope the report is read, cited, and used both for its clarifying and its heuristic value.

T3 Magazine,9/9/2016 11:03,"Is 3D bad for my eyes?
Considering human beings see in three dimensions without the help of unstylish glasses, there's been a surprising amount of concern about 3D TVs and movies. Sony and Samsung have tucked away health warnings in online terms of service for some of their 3D-ready technology with dizziness, nausea, involuntary muscle twitching and seizures among the possible consequences cited for prolonged exposure to it.
But while anyone who saw Piranha 3D or Resident Evil: Afterlife will see a licker of truth in that, experts aren't convinced.
""Our eyes are actually very good at concentrating on something like 3D,"" says Dr Rob Hogan, past president of the College of Optometrists. Hogan's bigger concern is that not everybody is getting the full immersive experience, with anybody who has a squint or lazy eye unlikely to perceive the effect.
""Even for the rest of us there are issues because most of us have one eye that's stronger than the other. Until prescription 3D glasses become commonplace that won't go away, but I've seen no evidence to suggest that just watching 3D causes any of these.""
Still, take care to avoid cinemas when Piranha 3DD – the sequel – arrives later this year. Better safe than sorry.
Could gadgets make me infertile?
A hot scrotum is an unhappy scrotum. It is believed that testes hang outside of the body because they do their best work a couple of degrees lower than body temperature.
For this reason, research has been carried out into the effect carrying a phone in your pocket all day or spending hours with a hot laptop could affect your, ahem, ""lap"".
One study from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio found that men who use phones for more than four hours a day had fewer sperm and that those they did have were lazy swimmers. ""There is also evidence that using a laptop on your lap can increase the temperature of a man's scrotum,"" says Dr Allan Pacey, an andrologist at the University of Sheffield. ""But there is no evidence that I am aware of that this affects sperm counts.""
Pacey concedes that lab results are often far removed from what might happen in real life. If you're still fretting – and are unable to work at a table – try using your laptop while sitting cross-legged with your legs spread apart. Research from Stony Brook University in New York found that this leads to a downstairs temperature saving of almost a degree.
Either way, don't panic, says Pacey. ""Male fertility is largely set by genetics and what happened to a male before he was born. Any man facing fertility problems might be advised to avoid heat and radiation from phones but there's no evidence that such exposures will reduce the chances of being a father.""
Can apps make me fit?
Death and disease? Yes, there's an app for that. Several in fact.
For instance, if you're worried an outbreak of swine flu or legionnaire's disease is brewing up the road, download HealthMap from the App Store. It uses Google Maps to alert you when there's any kind of outbreak in your neighbourhood.
The number of health-related apps has increased by 78 per cent since the beginning of 2010. In the mix are apps to monitor headaches, your heart rate, your blood pressure and more. They track your diet and fitness. Some even claim to measure your lung volume. But do these pocket medics actually improve your health?
""I think they're very useful,"" says Bupa medical director Annabel Bentley. ""Anything that gives us data and feedback and spurs us on to take a more active interest in our health is good.""
Research has shown that having access to personalised health information can trigger behaviour change. That's why there are so many weight loss and running trackers in the App Store. The only problem is that some people buy an app and think it will sit in their pocket and magically reduce their cholesterol or drag them out running.
The authors of a report called Mobile Health 2010 warn that apps that require constant updating and interactivity see a sharp drop-off in use. But while your iPhone should never replace your GP, the two can work together. ""If you use apps to measure different aspects of your health, your doctor could potentially use that info to treat you better,"" says Bentley.
What's a healthy number of friends on Facebook?
Resist the urge to collect friends and followers on social networking sites. The average Facebook user has 130 ""friends"", usually a mixture of genuine mates, colleagues and old contacts you wouldn't recognise if you passed on the street, and according to Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary anthropologist at Oxford University, that's a pretty healthy number.
Back in 1992, Dunbar determined that the size of our brains put a cap on the number of meaningful social relationships we can realistically manage. The so-called Dunbar Number is 150.
""There's an inner layer of about I've friends,"" he says. ""The next layer adds another 10, then there are more layers at 50 and 150. As you go further out, the amount of time you spend socialising with those people declines.""
Dunbar says that social networking sites haven't changed the basic principles of his theory. If you're hanging on to 700 people on Facebook, chances are you only communicate a lot with a core group. The immediacy of the internet lets you keep tabs on far-lung contacts and prevent them from slipping into the outer layers of your contact book but, ""the interesting question is whether you invest so heavily in those old relationships online that new relationships with people you live with at the moment suffer.""
Either way, it's worth clinging on to your friends one way or another. Research from Brigham Young University in Utah found that maintaining social bonds adds years to your life, so hold off on that Facebook cull for now.
Do satnavs cause accidents?
A 2008 survey by Direct Line claimed that almost 300,000 Britons had been
involved in road accidents where a satnav was implicated.
Tabloids are full of stories about drivers mindlessly heading into oncoming traffic, a low bridge or even a harbour, while the AA warns that punching in new destinations when you're cruising the middle lane can be dangerous – well, yeah. Furthermore, software that hasn't been updated can mean you're directed around older versions of the roads you're actually driving on.
In any case, it's advisable to wean yourself off the dashboard navigator for short and simple journeys – your brain will thank you for it. Researchers from University College London scanned the brains of London cabbies and found their hippocampus, the part of the brain involved in navigation, is a thicker slab of muscle than most of
us have.
""The hippocampus is crucial for navigation and we use it like a satnav,"" says Dr Hugo Spiers, who carried out the research. ""London taxi drivers, who have to know their way around hundreds of thousands of winding streets, have the most refined and powerful innate satnavs, strengthened over years of experience."" So put the computer away – you'll still reach your destination and it might make it less likely you reach your Final Destination, if you catch our drift...

Are mobiles bad for my posture?
An adult human head weighs 10lbs to 14lbs, roughly the same as a medium-sized bowling ball. When it sits directly on top of your neck and shoulders it's well-supported and no muscles are isolated. When you're hunched over Angry Birds in a cramped corner of the train carriage, things are different.
""The muscles in the back of your neck have to work a damn sight harder to support that bowling ball weight,"" says Tim Hutchful of the British Chiropractic Association. ""If you do it infrequently it's not a problem, but the thing with this is that it's cumulative. If you do it day in, day out, your muscles can adapt to that position and start to get less flexible.
"" Hutchful recommends ""counterstretching"" to reverse the effects and alleviate any stiffness. Hold your arms out to the side, palms facing up. Pull your shoulder blades back together and look up slightly. Hold for 10 seconds. ""It's almost the opposite of how you sit when you're hunched over,"" he says.
When you return to the game, try to straighten up by holding the handset closer to eye level and keep your head against a seatback or hand rail. ""Imagine a straight line going down past your ear, through your shoulder, hip, knees and ankles. In that position, you're really strong and virtually incompressible."" You'll find more anti-hump exercises at chiropractic-uk.co.uk/straightenup .
Is the internet addictive?
If you've ever lost a couple of hours on Facebook, Wikipedia or in less salubrious online establishments, the answer to this one might sound like a no brainer. Hell yes it's addictive, like a Class A pharmaceutical coming straight down your fibre optic.
Indeed, up to ten per cent of people are estimated to be ""web dependent"", with surfers spending up to 68 hours a month jacked in to the web. In the most extreme examples, online gaming addicts have died of heart failure after playing non-stop for 50 hours or more.
Not everybody agrees that the internet is the problem per se. ""Somebody addicted to online gambling is simply a gambling addict and somebody addicted to porn sites may be sex addicted,"" says Mark Griffiths, a technology addiction specialist at Nottingham Trent University. In these cases the internet is simply the place where addicts indulge in their chosen poison.
Griffiths also believes that for a small number of people, some features exclusive to the internet such as chat rooms or massively multiplayer games can be genuinely addictive.
Your own 60-times-a-day Google habit may be a compulsive behaviour, but that doesn't mean you've got a serious problem. ""We must be careful not to pathologise people's behaviour, even if it does seem excessive,"" says Griffiths. ""On balance, I think the benefits of the internet far outweigh the risks.""
Does harmful bacteria build up on my touchscreen?
In a word, yes. Your oh-so touchable touchscreen is crawling with bacteria. A study last year in the Journal of Applied Microbiology found that glass surfaces such as those on your expensive smartphone are the perfect breeding ground for bugs.
Another study by Which? reported that the average phone harbours 18 times more germs than your toilet flush, with one estimate claiming that there are 25,000 microscopic critters on every square inch.
Despite that, the likelihood that you'll catch MRSA while reading the news via 3G are very low. There are up to 100 trillion microbes living on or inside you at any given time with countless more festering in your keyboard and virtually every surface you come across. If they haven't killed you by now, there's no reason to suspect you'll quite literally ""go viral"" while watching YouTube. A cold or upset stomach aren't out of the question, though.
If that concerns you, your first line of defence should be to invest in a case designed to fight off bugs. Both Proporta and Ecoskin cases come with antimicrobial coatings claimed to reduce the spread of germs. Our advice? Just man up and get on with it.
Is the internet making me dumb?
Status updates, live scores, rolling news... Is it all too much? Research from the University of California calculated that we consume three times as much information today as we did in 1960.
For some scientists, the modern day info dump is something to be genuinely concerned about, and not just because everyone's logging on to Twitter at work. Our brains, they say, are not built to receive the non-stop datastream pouring down in the age of the tweet. For all of its positives, the always-on internet might just be making us that little bit more stupid.
In 2010 neuroscientist Baroness Susan Greenfield warned that the internet could infantilise our minds, with search engines hindering our ability to learn and social networking sites turning us into low-empathy automatons. ""Rather than sleepwalking into this,"" she warned, ""we should be the masters and not the slaves of technology, harnessing it in ways that we could do exciting and fulfilling things with.""
There is evidence to back up the Baroness' claims. One Stanford University study found that heavy multimedia users are less able to filter out irrelevant information and find it harder to focus on one task – anyone working with 15 tabs open at once can vouch for that. All those hyperlinks may be rewiring our synapses, turning us into easily distracted infovores, never staying on one topic for long before mentally double-clicking to the next.
Thank heavens, then, for tablet computers. Research from the University of Florida suggests that the interface on devices such as the iPad, with ""tiled"" windows and apps, as opposed to the ""stacked"" equivalent on desktops or laptops, may be better suited to the human brain and more conducive to learning. Have you heard a better reason to spend that £429?
What's a healthy number of friends on Facebook?
Resist the urge to collect friends and followers on social networking sites. The average Facebook user has 130 ""friends"", usually a mixture of genuine mates, colleagues and old contacts you wouldn't recognise if you passed on the street, and according to Robin Dunbar, an evolutionary anthropologist at Oxford University, that's a pretty healthy number.

Either way, it's worth clinging on to your friends one way or another. Research from Brigham Young University in Utah found that maintaining social bonds adds years to your life, so hold off on that Facebook cull for now.
Will computer games make me brainy?
It's important here to distinguish between ""brainy"" and ""intelligent"" but, according to Mark Griffiths of Nottingham Trent University, ""Computer games do have real therapeutic value and can increase certain skills such as hand-eye coordination.""
The evidence to support an extra half hour on the Xbox is now mounting up, with a series of studies at Rochester University in New York detailing the various real-life ""health packs"" you pick up during each session. Call of Duty and other first-person shooters, for example, reward gamers with faster reaction times, reduced stress, more efficient information processing and 20 per cent better visual acuity.
""It's no surprise that the military now actively recruits gamers because strategy games also clearly improve tactical thinking,"" says Griffiths. A 2010 study in the journal Current Biology found that gamers make faster decisions in the real world than non-gamers, and were just as accurate.
Before you load up a marathon session, however, be warned that it's not all good news. Prolonged gaming has also been linked to disrupted sleep patterns and a lower attention span which, er, what were we saying? Zzzzz...

KSL Newsradio Friday 9th September, 2016
PROVO (CNN) -- A 1,700-year-old obituary, which is unlike anything researchers say they have seen before, has finally been translated.
The inscription, written in ancient Greek on a small limestone tablet reveals a woman's name, her religion and what she was like as a person.
Lincoln H. Blumell who specializes in ancient scripture at Brigham Young University translated the epitaph. Plucked from Egypt, the document had been sitting in the Rare Books Department at the University of Utah's J Willard Marriott Library since it was donated in 1989.
It commemorates a woman...

ESPN.com,9/9/2016 11:11,"Bears' Paul Lasike in running for Polynesian Football Player of Year
4:55 PM ET
LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Chicago Bears fullback Paul Lasike took a circuitous route to the NFL.
Lasike, a native of Aukland, New Zealand and the ninth of 10 children in a Kiwi-Tongan family, enrolled at Brigham Young University on a rugby scholarship before making his college football debut for the Cougars in 2012.
Four years later, Lasike is the starting fullback on the Bears' Week 1 roster. Last season, Lasike spent all but two weeks on Chicago's practice squad, temporarily leaving the team early in the year to obtain an updated worker visa.
""It's unbelievable,"" Lasike said Thursday. ""I never would have envisioned myself several years ago looking down the road being here and being in this fortunate situation. It's huge. At first, the toughest part was just learning the game. It was frustrating, because football is a very technical sport. You watch football from the outside and you just see people running the ball and catching, but there is so much more to it. There are so many things like timing, and the other nuances of football that I had to learn. That has been the hardest thing.""
Bears fullback Paul Lasike didn't play football until suiting up for BYU in 2012. Fred Kfoury III/Icon Sportswire
On Thursday, the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame announced that Lasike is one of 19 players on the 2017 Polynesian Pro Football Player of the Year Award Watch list.
""I'm very proud of my heritage,"" Lasike said. ""We weren't brought up too much in the culture, but there were certain things that my dad was brought up with -- work ethic and stuff like that. Even when I played in Arizona [the summer of 2015], and here. I'm pretty close to all the other Polynesian players, which is pretty cool.""
Lasike might have a small edge. Former NFL center Kevin Mawae, whom the Bears recently hired to the coaching staff, is the inaugural member of the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame and one of eight voters for the award.
""Oh, really?"" Lasike said with a grin. ""Yeah, I've talked to him for sure. He seems like a really good guy.""
Among the other players on the watch list: Tennessee quarterback Marcus Mariota (Samoan), San Diego linebacker Manti Te'o (Samoan), Detroit defensive tackle Haloti Ngata (Tongan), Cincinnati linebacker Rey Maualuga (Samoan), and San Francisco defensive lineman DeForest Buckner (Samoan).

The Cowboys head coach caused quite the stir back in July as he debuted his latest ""mullet"" at the Big 12 Media Days to much fanfare.  While it isn't remotely the equal of the one he sported as a quarterback in Stillwater, it's still something not normally seen atop the head of an FbS head coach.
It's also something that's turned into a money-making venture for the university as OSU athletics' online store, as pointed out by Kyle Fredrickson of the Oklahoman, is selling shirts with Gundy's mulleted silhouette in profile emblazoned on them.
The short-sleeved t-shirts sell for $24.99 , the long-sleeved version shown above for $27.99 .  Get 'em while you can, if you're into such things.
That being said, what Gundy was wearing was not a mullet.  Sure, it's business in the front, but more like a casual shindig in the back.  Don't believe me?
"" It’s not a real mullet ,' Gundy said back in mid-July. 'A real mullet has to be at least shoulder length and you’ve got to have some curls in it.""
And, if anyone would know what's a mullet and what isn't, it's definitely Gundy.

Adding injury to the insult of Alabama's 52-6 destruction last Saturday, USC has announced that the program will be without starting center Toa Lobendahn for the rest of the season.
Head coach Clay Helton confirmed after the Trojans' practice on Thursday that the junior offensive lineman tore his ACL and MCL in the opener. Lobendahn started every game as a true freshman for USC but was sidelined halfway through the 2015 campaign with a similar knee injury.
Lobendahn sustained a knee injury on the second series against Alabama, but stayed in. He had surgery today. It was successful, Helton said.
Redshirt junior Nico Falah will take over at center for USC after backing up a number of positions along the line during his career and making one start. The Trojans boasted one of the best offensive lines in the country coming into the 2016 season but looked overmatched against Alabama's defensive front in the opener at AT&T Stadium.
The reshuffling along the offensive line as a result of the injury will be tested right away as the Trojans will play Utah State on Saturday for their home opener before beginning Pac-12 play with road trips to Stanford and Utah.
The future is now at Georgia.
True freshman Jacob Eason has been tapped by Bulldogs head coach Kirby Smart to start at quarterback this Saturday against Nicholls State, according to a report from the Atlantic Journal Constitution's DawgNation .
Eason, a five-star recruit from the state of Washington at this time a year ago, did not start in the team's opening 33-24 win over North Carolina but performed well in limited playing time. He finished 8-of-12 for 131 yards and a touchdown after coming in to replace senior starter Greyson Lambert.
The move to go with Eason is one that many Bulldogs fans have been pining for ever since he enrolled in January as the top pro-style quarterback prospect in the class of 2016. He will become the first true freshman signal-caller to start for Georgia since former No. 1 overall pick Matthew Stafford took the first snaps for the Bulldogs back in 2006.
Georgia moved to No. 9 in the AP Top 25 after their win over the Tar Heels.
Smart opting to start Eason against Nicholls State gives the freshman a chance to show what he can do under center before a season-defining stretch for Georgia over the next three weeks that includes trips to Missouri and Ole Miss before hosting SEC East division favorite Tennessee.
Mark Richt's return to his alma mater Miami has gotten off to a good start on the scoreboard thanks to a season opening 70-3 win over Florida A&M. In the injury department however, things have been anything but smooth sailing for the veteran head coach.
The school confirmed reports on Thursday night with a release stating that two defenders would be sidelined for the Hurricanes' game against Florida Atlantic, with starting cornerback Adrian Colbert and backup defensive tackle Adrian Colbert both suffering from what were officially labeled ""lower extremity injuries.""
The Palm Beach Post reported that Colbert suffered his injury during practice on Wednesday and tore the meniscus in his knee. The  Post also reported that Jenkins , who was hurt late in the season opener, underwent a minor surgery to fix the same issue.
The pair adds to a long list of players who will find themselves on the sideline this week against the Owls. As a result of the two latest injuries, the already shaky Miami defense appears as though it will get even younger and more inexperienced. The team started three true freshman linebackers in Week 1 and will likely have a mix of freshmen and sophomores starting in the secondary next to veteran Corn Elder.
It may not matter much for the Hurricanes this week against local rival FAU but a trip to face Appalachian State in Week 3 looms before starting ACC play in October. Dealing with a host of injuries is probably not what Richt scripted to begin the 2016 season.
Another week, another twist in the drama surrounding Big 12 expansion.
The latest move was made Wednesday night on the subject from an unlikely source: Iowa State's student government, which passed a resolution opposing BYU joining the Big 12 Conference.
'Student Government’s goal is to create a safe and all-inclusive campus where students feel supported to learn, grow and succeed,"" the group said in an official statement  obtained by the Ames Tribune . ""The Senate finds that Brigham Young University’s Honor Code does not communicate nor reflect the values that The Big XII Conference represents. Therefore, the Senate of Student Government does not support BYU’s membership bid to the Big XII at this time.'
The resolution will reportedly be sent to the presidents all every Big 12 school in addition to conference commissioner Bob Bowlsby.
BYU's honor code has been one of the chief sticking points surrounding the school's candidacy to join the Big 12 and a subject that has received quite a bit of attention ever since the league announced it was looking at expansion. The school, which is privately owned and operated by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has been criticized heavily over the years regarding sections of the code that prohibits homosexual behavior, among other things. National  LGBT advocacy groups have already sent letters to the Big 12 conference office urging them to avoid inviting the Cougars because of the school's stances but Wednesday's resolution by ISU's student government appears to be the first - and so far loudest - message made against BYU by one of the conference's current members.
Big 12 leaders are reportedly meeting with school officials from a group of roughly 10 finalists this week in Dallas. While it has not been made public when BYU will present their case, it appears likely that the thorny issue surrounding the honor code will play a key role as to whether the Cougars are ultimately invited to join the conference or if they will remain an independent school in football.
It's doubtful that a student government resolution would be enough to truly derail the otherwise strong case BYU has to join the Big 12 but, given all of the twists and turns that have already happened with conference expansion, stranger things have happened.

#ColinKaepernickSyllabus | New Black Man in Exile
On September 4, Rebecca Martinez tweeted Louis Moore and David J. Leonard, suggesting the creation of Colin Kaepernick Syllabus. Soon, we, along with  Bijan C. Bayne, Sarah J. Jackson, and many others began the work of creating a syllabus to hopefully elevate and empower the conversations that Colin Kaepernick started when he decided to sit down in protest during an August 26, 2016 preseason game.  
Building on the framework established by Chad Williams, Kidada Williams, and Keisha Blain, with their monumental #CharlestonSyllabus, Marcia Chatelain with #FergusonSyllabus and subsequent efforts from Candice Benbow with #LemonadeSyllabus and others who have sought to not only use social media and online technology to crowdsource and aggregate conversations, this syllabus represents an effort to bring  together multiple conversations, histories, disciplines, discourses, and spaces.  If we are going to follow Colin Kaepernick’s lead to have conversations and work toward justice, we must do so with the necessary tools and collective understanding.  This requires engaging multiple conversations, entering into these spaces with a historic foundation, with knowledge about the persistent realities of racial injustice and inequality, with insight into the longstanding struggles of the Black athlete.  This syllabus represents an attempt to aid in these conversations, to turn our everyday conversations, debates, and discourse into a classroom, all while making sure our institutionalized classrooms are engaged with the histories, struggles, and public discourses that shape our current moment.  
Harry Edwards recently recently wrote, “silence is evil’s greatest and most consistently dependable ally.” For all those engaged in these conversations, for those who have written, spoke about, and organized around racial injustice, silence is antithetical to our work, our ethos.  Yet, too often people speak past one another; too many people presume because of the everyday saturation of sports culture, the ubiquity of media coverage of the Colin Kaepernick, and the hypervisibility (and invisibility) of racial discourse, along with the belief that this is all about opinions and “two sides” that they are prepared for these important conversations.   
Too often, especially within the media and from those whose whiteness - their privilege - insulates, empowers, and protects, people speak without the requisite tools, without the requisite historic foundation, and without necessary information. This offers a toolbox of knowledge, links to resources, and information. The #Kaepernick syllabus furthers the efforts to disrupt the silence, to make connections, and to otherwise build on the work of Kaepernick, Edwards, members of the WNBA, Bomani Jones, Serena Williams, and so many others demanding that we speak and act.  While continuing the conversation is important, it must be done so with literacy and knowledge about American racism, the history of sports, the African American athlete, #BLM, protests, and so much more.  Discussions aren’t inherently transformative but with the requisite understanding, introspection about privilege and widely-held assumptions, and critical examination, we are better equipped as we walk toward justice and radical transformation #KapernickSyllabus #WeSitWithKaep

University attrition rates: Why are so many students dropping out?
Liz Burke, news.com.au
September 9, 2016 7:48am
FIRST year university students are leaving their original chosen courses at a higher rate than ever.
New data shows about one in five commencing bachelor students left their original course in 2014, and about 15 per cent dropped out completely.
The figures also see the increase in the number of students not completing their chosen course climb to more than one million for the first time.
Education Minister Simon Birmingham and Universities Australia, the peak body representing Australian universities, are defending the figures. They point out that while overall attrition rates are up, when it comes to the percentage of students dropping out of university completely in their first year (the adjusted attrition rate), the average figure is similar to past years, sticking at around 15 per cent for the past decade.
But the number of students leaving their first year courses is increasing — whether they find another place for themselves in the higher education system or not.
At the university with the worst attrition rate, the University of Tasmania, 42.26 per cent of first year students left their course during the first year, with most of those — 38.13 per cent of all first year students — dropped out of university altogether.
The University of Melbourne had the lowest attrition rate at 7.5 per cent. Its adjusted rate — taking out students who had left their course but enrolled in another — was only 3.74 per cent.
Universities Australia Deputy Chief Executive Catriona Jackson told news.com.au the attrition rates were no indictment on tertiary education providers. Rather, it was a “major achievement” that university access had been expanded to more Australians while keeping the dropout rate relatively stable.
“Research suggests attrition rates are higher for mature age and part-time students — and if you think about it, they’re the ones who may often be juggling university study with jobs, children and caring for elderly parents,” she said.
“Students battling disadvantage — including those who are first in their family to attend university — are also more likely to have thoughts about leaving.”
The experiences of disadvantaged students highlighted the importance of student support programs run by universities, which help students to find the support and resources they need to complete their degree, Ms Jackson said.
“The biggest factors for students who consider leaving university are often related to issues beyond university,” she said.
“They cite pressures with their health or stress, juggling work/life balance, the need to do paid work, their overall workload and financial difficulties among the top reasons for doing so.”
Grattan Institute higher education expert Andrew Norton told The Australian the attrition rates were worrying.
“The question is: are universities actually informing students of the risks they are taking on, particularly studying online, and are they being responsible in taking on students who are at high risk of not completing?”
The new data comes as the Federal Government awaits a report detailing recommendations about how best to make things clearer for students and keep them better informed.
The Higher Education Standards Panel, which is currently reviewing submissions over university admissions, has acknowledged greater transparency for students is needed to reshape higher education.

By KAREEM COPELAND
AP Sports Writer
SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — BYU and Utah may have as much crossover within the two programs as any two major football schools in the country.
BYU coach Kalani Sitake was the Utah defensive coordinator just two seasons ago and was one of the first hires by 12th-year Utes coach Kyle Whittingham.
That dynamic makes it a little different than other rivalries across the nation. It doesn’t have the national cache of Michigan-Ohio State or Alabama-Auburn but the animosity in the state is very real. The two meet next on Saturday in Salt Lake City.
'I just want to shut them up, honestly,' Utah receiver Tim Patrick said. 'I hear about it 24-7 since I got here. I experienced it in the bowl game. Seen videos of the trash talking. I want to be on the winning end, on that side. Be one of the guys that shuts them up.'
Whittingham and three Utah assistants played at BYU while Sitake and three of his assistants were once on the Utah staff. Guy Holliday went from coaching receivers at BYU last season to Utah now.
Brothers Kai Nacua (BYU) and Samson Nacua (Utah) will be on opposite sidelines and BYU defensive end Harvey Langi began his collegiate career at Utah.
As heated as the rivalry can get, both sides have downplayed how much the familiarity will actually factor in Saturday. Though Whittingham acknowledged Holiday has provided some insight on individual players.
'With anything with social media, that kind of fuels the fire a lot of times for people,' BYU offensive coordinator Ty Detmer said. 'It’s definitely more intense, probably, then when I was here because you didn’t hear that part of it and see some of those things. That adds to it a little bit. But with Kalani having been there a long time and the fans loving him when he coached at Utah, there’s maybe not the bitterness that has been there in the past.'
Sitake grew up a BYU fan and played for the Cougars before being joining the Utah staff for a decade. He and Whittingham golfed together multiple times during the summer and remain close friends.
Sitake’s presence may have an impact on the vitriol, but it was just December when former Utah defensive tackle Seni Fauonuku called BYU 'a dirty team' before the two played in the Las Vegas Bowl — a 35-28 Utah win.
BYU linebacker Fred Warner remembers.
'Just the way they came at us during the bowl game and some of the activities, just didn’t feel right,' Warner said.
It was just January when Utah men’s basketball coach Larry Krystkowiak canceled the series between the two teams due to a 'venomous and toxic environment.' Utah lawmakers then ordered an audit of the University of Utah sports department after the game was canceled. The athletic directors decided to renew the series in 2017-18.
Utah defensive end Kylie Fitts thinks it’s the nastiest rivalry in the country.
'You guys don’t hear or see what goes on on the field and under the piles,' Fitts said. 'It’s nasty, but there’s definitely respect for both teams. … It’s electric. You can feel it in the air. You can feel it in practice. You can feel it in the weight room. For me personally, I feel it’s as heated as it’s ever been.'
The upperclassmen on the Utah defense were recruited by Sitake and Fitts said the BYU coach is basically the reason he’s at Utah.
BYU defensive end Corbin Kaufusi has been on both sides since his dad Steve flipped from the Utah staff to the BYU staff in 2002.
'I remember my older brother and my little brother, we used to always paint our faces black with the red,' Kaufusi said. 'It’s kind of funny to be on the other side of it now. I remember when I was younger, it did seem like it got a little snippy and there were times where it’s a little dirtier than it needs to be.'

By Mary Bellis Updated August 21, 2016 . 
Charles Ginsburg led the research team at Ampex Corporation in developing one of the first practical videotape recorders or VTRs in 1951. It captured live images from television cameras by converting the information into electrical impulses and saving the information on magnetic tape. By 1956, VTR technology was perfected and in common use by the television industry. 
But Ginsburg wasn’t done yet. He led the Ampex research team in developing a new machine that could run the tape at a much slower rate because the recording heads rotated at high speed. This allowed the necessary high-frequency response. He became known as the ""father of the video cassette recorder.” Ampex sold the first VTR for $50,000 in 1956, and the first VCassetteRs -- or VCRs -- were sold by Sony in 1971. The Early Days of Video Recording 
Film was initially the only medium available for recording television programs -- magnetic tape was considered, and it was already being used for sound, but the greater quantity of information carried by the television signal demanded new studies. A number of American companies began investigating this problem during the 1950s. Tape Recording Technology 
Audio and video magnetic recording has had a greater impact on broadcasting than any other development since the invention of radio/TV transmission itself. Video tape in a large cassette format was introduced by both JVC and Panasonic around 1976. This was the most popular format for home use and for video store rentals for many years until it was replaced by CDs and DVDs. VHS stands for Video Home System. The First Television Cameras 
American engineer, scientist and inventor Philo Taylor Farnsworth devised the television camera in the 1920s, although he would later declare that ""there's nothing on it worthwhile."" It was an “image dissector” that converted a captured imagine into an electrical signal. 
Farnsworth was born in 1906 on Indian Creek in Beaver County, Utah. His parents expected him to become a concert violinist but his interests drew him to experiments with electricity. He built an electric motor and produced the first electric washing machine his family ever owned at the age of 12. He then went on to attend Brigham Young University where he researched television picture transmission. Farnsworth had already conceived of his idea for television while in high school, and he cofounded Crocker Research Laboratories in 1926 which he later renamed Farnsworth Television, Inc. He then changed the name again to Farnsworth Radio and Television Corporation in 1938. 
Farnsworth was the first inventor to transmit a television image comprised of 60 horizontal lines in 1927. He was only 21 years old. The image was a dollar sign. 
One of the keys to his success was the development of the dissector tube that essentially translated images into electrons that could be transmitted to a TV. He filed for his first television patent in 1927. He had already won an earlier patent for his image dissection tube, but he lost later patent battles to RCA, which owned the rights to many of inventor Vladimir Zworkyin’s TV patents. 
Farnsworth went on to invent over 165 different devices. He held over 300 patents by the end of his career, including a number of significant television patents -- although he was not a fan of what his discoveries had wrought. His final years were spent battling depression and alcohol. He died on March 11, 1971, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Digital Photography and Video Stills 
Digital camera technology is directly related to and evolved from the same technology that once recorded television images. Both television/video cameras and digital cameras use a CCD or charged coupled device to sense light color and intensity. 
A still video or digital camera called the Sony Mavica single-lens reflex was first demonstrated in 1981. It used a fast-rotating magnetic disc that was two inches in diameter and could record up to 50 images formed in a solid-state device inside the camera. The images were played back through a television receiver or monitor, or they could be printed out. Advancements in Digital Technology 
NASA converted from using analog to digital signals with their space probes to map the surface of the moon in the 1960s, sending digital images back to earth. Computer technology was also advancing at this time and NASA used computers to enhance the images that the space probes were sending. Digital imaging had another government use at the time – in spy satellites. 
Government use of digital technology helped advance the science of digital imaging, and the private sector also made significant contributions. Texas Instruments patented a filmless electronic camera in 1972, the first to do so. Sony released the Sony Mavica electronic still camera in August 1981, the first commercial electronic camera. Images were recorded onto a mini disc and placed into a video reader that was connected to a television monitor or color printer. The early Mavica cannot be considered a true digital camera, however, even though it started the digital camera revolution. It was a video camera that took video freeze-frames. The First Digital Cameras 
Since the mid-1970s, Kodak has invented several solid-state image sensors that ""convert light to digital pictures"" for professional and home consumer use. Kodak scientists invented the world's first megapixel sensor in 1986, capable of recording 1.4 million pixels that could produce a 5 x 7 inch digital photo-quality print. Kodak released seven products for recording, storing, manipulating, transmitting and printing electronic still video images in 1987, and in 1990, the company developed the Photo CD system and proposed ""the first worldwide standard for defining color in the digital environment of computers and computer peripherals."" Kodak released the first professional digital camera system (DCS), aimed at photojournalists in 1991, a Nikon F-3 camera equipped with a 1.3 megapixel sensor. 
The first digital cameras for the consumer market that would work with a home computer via a serial cable were the Apple QuickTake camera in 1994, the Kodak DC40 camera in 1995, the Casio QV-11 also in 1995, and Sony's Cyber-Shot Digital Still Camera in 1996. Kodak entered into an aggressive co-marketing campaign to promote its DC40 and to help introduce the idea of digital photography to the public. Kinko's and Microsoft both collaborated with Kodak to create digital image-making software workstations and kiosks which allowed customers to produce photo CD discs and add digital images to documents. IBM collaborated with Kodak in making an Internet-based network image exchange. 
Hewlett-Packard was the first company to make color inkjet printers that complemented the new digital camera images. The marketing worked and now digital cameras are everywhere.

Mike Dooley,9/9/2016 11:47,"Campus Pride releases Shame List of worst colleges for LGBT students
4 hours ago
Campus Pride, the LGBT activist group, is compiling a ""Shame List"" to highlight ""harmful and shameful acts of religion-based prejudice and bigotry"" allegedly committed by religious colleges in the United States. Numerous schools listed have requested a religious-based exemption from Title IX which prohibits discrimination against LGBT students and faculty. Two Massachusetts colleges made the list.
Andrews University and Spring Arbor University are among those considered ""dangerous"" for LGBT students, according to Campus Pride.
""And the reason why we call it a shame list is because, you know, Campus Pride believes that anytime you use religion as a way to justify discrimination and harm toward a group of people, than that's wrong"", Windmeyer said. Campus Pride claims all colleges discriminate against LGBT youth in policies, programs and practices. At that time, the campuses applying for these discriminatory waivers did so privately, Campus Pride says.
They based their conclusions on two things: ""A college received and/or applied for a Title IX exemption to discriminate against LGBTQ youth and/or demonstrated past history and track record of anti-LGBTQ actions, programs and practices"".
Multnomah University applied for a Title IX waiver in 2015 on religious grounds but has not been approved. The school did not respond to a request for comment. Without the exemption, the school claims it can not teach a religious belief it holds that gender is pre-determined.
Windmeyer said in a statement, ""Ultimately these campuses are unsafe for vulnerable LGBTQ youth and others"". ""All families and youth deserve to know this information and so do corporations who do business with these campuses"".
If the school explicitly states in its official publications that it is controlled by a religious organization committed to the teachings of a particular religion, and it receives significant financial support from the controlling religious organization.
For example, at Brigham Young University, the Mormon school located in Utah, The Salt Lake Tribune reported that any activity perceived as homosexual or gender-nonconforming can violate the strict honor code, leading to sanctions of LGBT students even if they are raped or sexually assaulted.
The nation's first accredited Muslim college, California's Zaytuna, isn't on the list, perhaps because President Hamza Yusuf Hanson personally signed a letter against SB 1146.
Boston Baptist College has qualified for the Shame List because it has applied for an exemption to Title IX in order to discriminate against its students on the bases of sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, pregnancy or receipt of abortion while still receiving federal funds.

coolhorn46,9/9/2016 12:09,"If I was a betting man, I'd put my money on the side of BYU not being invited into the B-12.
It has little to do with their honor code, or refusal to play on Sunday. If it did, they could be invited in on a football only basis.
The B-12 wants to find a viable traveling partner for West Virginia, which right now is on an island in the B-12. The best option there is Cincy as far as what the conference is looking for in new members. They're in a desirable market, have a competitive football team, and the potential of becoming a positive add.
The conference is looking for a value-added sports program, and the University of Houston is the next logical choice. They're a very good football program, and very competitive in basketball and baseball. They would solidify the B-12 presence in Houston, one of the biggest markets in the B-12 footprint, and Houston has a prior history of top level college athletic success.
I don't think the B-12 adds four teams, at least just yet, so I see Houston and Cincy as numbers eleven and twelve. If he conference does eventually go to fourteen or sixteen, I see expansion going east, not west, because of market size.
BYU has the misfortune of being too far west to fit into the B-12 footprint. I think Colorado is about as far west as the B-12 is looking right now.
B-12 expansion really isn't about any religious stances or other peripheral matters....It's about finding teams that meet conference needs and at least potentially add value. BYU's got a good sports program, but they're in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's the gist of why I don't think they get an invite to the B-12.

New Cassini images show dunes on Titan Posted on September 9, 2016 by Laurel Kornfeld Scientists believe the grains covering the dunes originated as atmospheric hydrocarbons.Credit: NASA / JPL-CALTECH / ASI / UNIVERSITE PARIS-DIDEROT 125 Subscribe Mail Sign up to receive our weekly newsletter of the most popular space stories: 
Images of Saturn’s largest moon Titan obtained by NASA’s Cassini orbiter during a recent close flyby reveal long, linear dunes indicative of a dynamic environment. 
Taken July 25 from a distance of just 607 miles (976 km) above the large moon’s surface, the images were captured by the orbiter’s radar instrument, which is capable of seeing through Titan’s thick atmospheric haze to resolve detailed surface features. 
From these latest images, along with a video, scientists theorize the long dunes are composed of hydrocarbon grains that originated in Titan’s atmosphere. 
Previous flybys of Titan by Cassini have already revealed the presence of similar dunes along most of its equatorial region. 
Studying dunes can inform scientists about their composition and about the winds that created them. 
“Dunes are dynamic features. They’re deflected by obstacles along the downwind path, often making beautiful, undulating patterns,” explained Cassini radar team associate Jani Radebaugh of Brigham Young University in Utah. 
Most of Cassini’s recent flyby was over Titan’s southern latitudes. 
The flyby revealed a new mountainous region much like the first surface feature ever seen on Titan, named Xanadu, initially imaged in 1994 by the Hubble Space Telescope. 
Nicknamed the “Xanadu annex,” this new area, previously measured by Cassini but not imaged in radar, is smaller but composed of the same mountainous terrain that comprises Xanadu and various other areas on Titan’s surface. 
Unlike its larger counterpart, Xanadu annex had not been detected by Hubble. 
“This ‘annex’ looks quite similar to Xanadu using our radar, but there seems to be something different about the surface there that masks this similarity when observing with other wavelengths, as with Hubble. It’s an interesting puzzle,” noted Cassini radar team member Mike Janssen of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. 
Xanadu and Xanadu annex are the only large mountainous terrains on Titan. Other mountain areas are small and scattered. 
Cassini radar team member Rosaly Lopes, also of JPL, theorizes the mountainous regions are the oldest terrains on the large moon’s surface, likely composed of remnants of its icy crust before that crust was covered with hydrocarbons from the atmosphere. Leave a comment

Zachary Reyes,9/9/2016 12:31,"These 102 Colleges Are the 'Absolute Worst' for LGBT Students
Author: Zachary Reyes

Campus Pride is an educational organization for LGBT students and college campus groups.
Just in time for back-to-school season, national non-profit Campus Pride has released its lists of the best and worst colleges for LGBTQ students.
BYU-Idaho, which is owned and operated by the LDS Church, made the list after receiving a Title IX exemption.
Among those listed are colleges and universities that are well-known nationwide, and many that are not.
Texas, California, Missouri, Florida, Oklahoma, and Kentucky all have more than four colleges on the Shame List , Windmeyer said, adding that the South has the highest density of schools on Campus Pride's list.
Every year Campus Pride releases a ""Best of the Best"" listing highlighting college campuses with the most inclusive LGBTQ-friendly policies, programs and practices. Campus Pride claims all colleges discriminate against LGBT youth in policies, programs and practices. ""Which, you know, they are argue that their religious beliefs the right and it does allow them the right"", Windmeyer said.
The Shame List, Windmeyer said, ""uncovers the religion-based bigotry that is harmful and perpetuated against LGBTQ youth on these campuses"". Title IX, originally introduced to ban discrimination in education, has been ""transformed into a bureaucratic structure consisting of policies, procedures, and organization forms that regulate conduct"" between 1972 and 2011, according to Harvard professors Jacob Gerson and Jeannie Suk. Without the exemption, the school claims it can not teach a religious belief it holds that gender is pre-determined.
The Obama Administration this year issued a directive to schools that receive federal funding that if they discriminated against transgender students, they would risk federal funding. The fundraiser was organized by AULL4One, the school's unrecognized LGBT group. At that time, the campuses applying for these discriminatory waivers did so privately.
""Ultimately these campuses are risky for vulnerable LGBTQ youth and others"".
For example, at Brigham Young University, the Mormon school located in Utah, The Salt Lake Tribune reported that any activity perceived as homosexual or gender-nonconforming can violate the strict honor code , leading to sanctions of LGBT students - even if they are raped or sexually assaulted . A number have contributed tens of thousands of dollars to help defeat pro-LGBT bills in their states, including several of the 16 Californian colleges in the list.
Campus Reform notes that the largest denominational presence on the shame list is the Southern Baptist Convention, with 30 affiliated institutions.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Awards Three Grants for Combination Studies of Peregrine Pharmaceuticals’ Bavituximab in Multiple Cancers
Source:
GLOBE NEWSWIRE
September 6, 2016
TUSTIN, Calif., Sept. 06, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) - Peregrine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:PPHM) (NASDAQ:PPHMP), a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving patient lives by manufacturing high quality products for biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and advancing its proprietary R&D pipeline, today announced that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network® (NCCN®) Oncology Research Program (ORP) has awarded three grants to investigators to support research of bavituximab in combination with other therapeutics for the treatment of glioblastoma, head and neck cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma.
NCCN, a not-for-profit alliance of 27 of the world's leading cancer centers devoted to patient care, research, and education, is dedicated to improving the quality, effectiveness, and efficiency of cancer care so that patients can live better lives. Funding for the three investigator-initiated clinical studies will take place through a $2 million research grant made by Peregrine to NCCN’s ORP. NCCN will be responsible for oversight and monitoring of the clinical studies through the research grant. It is expected that the selected trials will be initiated in early 2017.
'NCCN is excited to initiate three studies by accomplished investigators at NCCN Member Institutions that will explore the effect of this novel immunotherapy in three different cancers with significant unmet need,' said Robert C. Young, MD, Interim Vice President, NCCN ORP.
The following NCCN-affiliated researchers were recipients of the grant awards:
Jessica Frakes, MD, Moffitt Cancer Center, 'A Phase I Trial of Sorafenib and Bavituximab Plus Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) for Unresectable Hepatitis C Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma'
Elizabeth Gerstner, MD, Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, 'Phase I/II Clinical Trial of Bavituximab with Radiation and Temozolomide for Patients with Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma'
Ranee Mehra, MD, The Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 'Phase II Study of Pembrolizumab and Bavituximab for Progressive Recurrent/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck'
'Our collaboration with NCCN provides the unique opportunity to support the group’s highly-regarded research institutions and advance our understanding of the potential role of bavituximab in the treatment of various cancers. With this in mind, we were very pleased by the level of interest shown in bavituximab from the NCCN community and are grateful to all those who submitted their projects for rigorous evaluation by the ORP scientific review committee,' said Joseph Shan, MPH, vice president, clinical and regulatory affairs of Peregrine. 'We’d like to extend our congratulations to the three investigators who were selected for their unique and innovative concepts. These studies align with our development strategy for bavituximab which is currently focused on small, early stage clinical trials evaluating the drug in combination with other cancer treatments. Collaborators such as NCCN play a central role in this strategy and we look forward to integrating the valuable clinical data generated by these investigators to expand our knowledge regarding bavituximab-focused cancer treatment combinations.'
Bavituximab is an investigational chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets phosphatidylserine (PS). Signals from PS inhibit the ability of immune cells to recognize and fight tumors. Bavituximab is believed to override PS mediated immunosuppressive signaling by blocking the engagement of PS with its receptors as well as by sending an alternate immune activating signal. PS targeting antibodies have been shown to shift the functions of immune cells in tumors, resulting in multiple signs of immune activation and anti-tumor immune responses.

Training wild goannas not to eat cane toads September 9, 2016 by Kandy Curran, Sciencenetwork Wa Yellow-spotted floodplain monitor (Varanus panoptes) are imperiled with the invasive cane toad expansion in Western Australia. Credit: Roebuck Bay Working Group Inc. 
Within minutes of starting her fascinating science presentation in Broome, Ecologist Georgia Ward-Fear transported her audience to a remote floodplain of the Forrest River in the East Kimberley. 
Using films, photos and a lively presentation style, Georgia had the audience alongside, waiting in the long grass for a Yellow-spotted floodplain monitor (Varanus panoptes) to appear, so the Balanggarra Rangers she works with, could dash out and capture the reptile—known locally as 'Gundulla', then feed it a 'teacher toad.' 
With the West Kimberley one of the last 'mega diverse' places in tropical Australia to be invaded by cane toads , the audience of more than 70, were keen to hear what researchers are doing to reduce the cane toad's devastating impacts on the wildlife in the region. 
What is particularly alarming about these Amazonian toads (Bufo marinus), is their rate of adaptation to the Australian environment, including recent physiological changes that have enabled faster travel across northern Australian, and a high fecundity. Did you know that females can lay up to 60,000 eggs per year? 
The aim of Georgia's research is to aid the survival of goannas as the cane toads move with alarming speed westward into the Kimberley. Trialling a new technique called 'conditioned taste aversion therapy,' the goannas are exposed to small doses of toad toxin (young teacher toads of a certain size) just before the real cane toad invasion reaches an area. These small toads will make the goannas sick, but won't kill them. The good news is that the training is working, with the goannas remembering their bad experience and avoiding the large toads that could kill them. 
When asked why she had singled out wild goannas for taste aversion training, Georgia indicated the importance of these goannas as apex predators in keeping local ecosystems stable, have sensory tongues and are intelligent which helps with their training. Moreover, the wild goannas are culturally important. 
""Time is running out for our wildlife, so the question should not be 'what is the cost of trying?' rather, 'what is the cost of doing nothing?'"" Georgia Ward-Fear said. Eradicating cane toads with 'their own medicine' November 14, 2011

For Season 15, we’re back!” The premiere kicks off with the designers — who range in age from 22 to 55 — scrambling to put together looks using only materials found at what they thought was just a Season 15 launch party. Throughout the competition, they’ll have to impress some A-list talent: Priyanka Chopra, Nina Dobrev and Savannah Guthrie all help judge the runway looks alongside Heidi Klum, Nina Garcia and Zac Posen. For Gunn, Runway’s backstage glimpse at the creative process is what keeps fans coming back even after 15 seasons: “And that’s what keeps me so enthusiastic about it.”

ISU student senator compares BYU Honor Code to race killing 2 hours ago Facebook 
If you’ve been dying to know what the Iowa State University student government thinks about BYU and the Big 12, then you’re in for a treat. 
Thursday, the ISU student government spent almost an hour debating the merits of BYU’s honor code and the “values of the Big 12,” culminating in a resolution expressing the group’s opposition to BYU’s inclusion in that conference. 
The debate and resultant resolution highlighted everything that is wrong with public universities today. 
Most notably, the student who introduced the resolution compared BYU’s honor code to a black athlete who was killed for his race. 
Seriously. 
From the Iowa State Daily : 
“[Sen. Abhijit] Patwa introduced the resolution to the Senate by citing an anecdote to Jack Trice, the first African-American athlete at Iowa State College. Trice died following a football game against the University of Minnesota in 1923, after sustaining injuries during the game. 
‘[It is] widely accepted that the attack on Jack Trice was racially motivated,’ Patwa said, further referencing that by passing this resolution that it’s time Student Government ‘take a stance to what we believe in.'” 
I don’t think I need to elaborate on the ridiculousness of invoking race killings in a debate about the BYU honor code. It’s irresponsible and ignorant on its face and has no place in a serious debate about the issues. Iowa State has failed Mr. Patwa and anyone who thinks this comparison was a good idea. 
Notably, despite their apparent concerned about the way things are going at BYU, the ISU student government opted to not even send a copy of the resolution to the BYU administration. This seems to be par for the course with BYU’s LGBT opponents. 
The lopsided 21-6 vote aside, there was actually some spirited debate on the topic. Like a breath of fresh air, one student expressed free speech and religious liberty concerns. Another pointed out that BYU is entitled to its beliefs, and students usually attend the university because of their beliefs. 
But the bill’s most outspoken critic was the student body president, Cole Staudt. At the debate, Cole argued that, though he opposes BYUs honor code, “You can’t change people by making them sit in the corner.” After the resolution passed, Staudt issued a press release via Twitter, noting that “I do not think we would be any better than BYU if the Big 12 chooses to reject them because of their beliefs.” In response to the Senate's BYU resolution, I have issued the following statement: pic.twitter.com/7FoCI595F0 
— ISU StuGov President (@ISUStuGovPres) September 8, 2016 
Thank goodness there is some sanity at public universities. Unfortunately, it is a tiny minority. 
The scariest part, though, is that students feel ok about comparing religious codes of conduct to race killings. The resolution is meaningless and is sure to have exactly zero impact, but the debate itself shows that universities are failing at teaching students about honest, intellectual discussion. 
I wonder if that comports with the values of the Big 12. You may also like

Six candidates are running for three seats on the Capistrano Unified School District’s Board of Trustees in Areas 1, 2 and 3, which cover schools in South Orange County. Each area has two candidates vying for a seat, and in Area 3, both candidates are newcomers, as incumbent John Alpay is running for a seat on the South Orange County Community College District Board of Trustees.
There is also a fourth seat up for election in Trustee Area 5, which covers schools in Aliso Viejo and Laguna Niguel. Incumbent Gary Pritchard is running against three candidates: Jorge Velastegui, Monica Maddox and Jake Vollebregt.
The Dana Point Times asked the six candidates running in Areas 1, 2 and 3 to submit a statement on who they are and why they’re running for a seat on the CUSD Board of Trustees. Candidates’ responses are listed in the same order that they’ll appear on the Nov. 8 general election ballot.
Additionally, the CUSD Board of Trustees voted in August to call a school bond election within the newly formed School Facilities Improvement District #2, which encompasses the entire district except for Rancho Mission Viejo. If 55 percent of voters approve the $889 million general obligation bond measure on Nov. 8, residents living within SFID #2 will be taxed $43 for every $100,000 of assessed value on their homes to help the district leverage state funds to pay for over $800 million in deferred facilities maintenance.

My husband, Richard, and I moved to San Clemente 20 years ago. We are grateful to call South Orange County home. We have two children who both attend CUSD schools. We are continually impressed by the commitment of parents and businesses supporting our schools.
I am running for CUSD Trustee because we need better leadership and representation on our school board. Too many feel we don’t have “a seat at the CUSD table.” Residents feel unheard and unrepresented. We can change this. Let’s get away from the “top-down” approach and start engaging our communities.
Working alongside our educators, we can make the quality of local education match the quality of our communities. More students need the opportunity to stretch their abilities in advanced courses. We have too many students below minimum standards in English and math. Our occupational training programs should match skills needed in the current job market. We can meet these challenges because we are engaged in our children’s education.
I don’t support Measure M, the $889 million bond. We cannot commit to unnecessary debt and expect our children to repay it. Our school board must be a better steward of our tax dollars and earn community trust. I will insist on clear, detailed reporting of spending and look for reasonable ways to save money and redirect funds back to our kids. No family should be asked to subsidize the school district unless all other means of funding have been explored.
I have been a small business owner for 20 years, specializing in software development. I design solutions to complex problems within tight budgets. On behalf of students, taxpayers and educators, I will apply my skills and experience for solutions to issues facing CUSD.
Now is the time to elect better leadership on the CUSD Board.

Amy Hanacek, Incumbent
As an involved parent of two CUSD graduates, I witnessed firsthand what our Founding Fathers knew: public education is essential to our country’s common good. During my time on the board, we have experienced rapid growth in science, technology, engineering, arts and math, and have expanded school of choice opportunities. My personal mission remains focused on the needs of all students and creating productive citizens through high-quality education.
As a longtime resident of Capistrano Beach and retired small business owner, I am keenly aware of the positive impact successful local schools have on property values and how they maintain the vitality of our communities. My commitment as School Board Trustee is to enhance the academic strength and quality of Capistrano Unified School District schools and to reinforce the direct correlation between strong, healthy schools and vibrant, safe communities, protecting our investments in our homes and in our neighborhoods.
I utilize my background as a small business owner and experienced board member to practice fiscal prudence while working to maximize every possible resource and to keep those resources in the classrooms and for our students. I serve on the College and Career Advantage Board (formerly South Coast ROP), which provides relevant cutting-edge career technical education and college/career pathways for CUSD students and adults. I am also working to launch the comprehensive College and Career Center in the Shops at Mission Viejo, serving the needs of 21st-century students and their busy families. Despite severe fiscal challenges created in Sacramento, my focus is to provide our children with maximum educational opportunities so that they may pursue their college and career goals to become tomorrow’s educated workforce and innovators.
More than ever, our children deserve a quality public education that provides unlimited opportunities to effectively compete and excel.

Gould Workman, Sales Manager
I have worked the past 22 years as a project manager and sales manager. I have learned to value “the team,” lead by example and effectively plan and communicate. I am active in our community, serve in a key role on our PTA board, and am active in my church, serving and working with our valuable youth. I am also a graduate of Brigham Young University.
As a father of five children in our district, and the husband to an amazing wife and CUSD teacher, I want to continue taking an active role in the improvement of our local education system. I am deeply committed to helping our schools adequately plan for the challenges of future growth within the district’s limited funding resources. At the heart of it all, I believe, unequivocally, in the value of public education. I believe in the democratic process and understand that a trustee’s role is to act in line with the interests of the entire school community, with total fiscal responsibility. For the past 15 years, our district board of trustees has not actively put the constituents first. I am the solution to this and the advocate for change, putting our kids and families in our district first in everything.
Unfortunately, many in our community are outraged by the dismissive treatment of the current school board. It is my resolute commitment to listen to and represent all members of the community and allow their voices to be reflected in the decisions the board makes. If elected, I will use my voice to refocus our administration on what is truly important—our children, teaching and learning. I hope you will give me the opportunity to serve you and our awesome district by voting for me this coming Election Day.

Jim Reardon, Incumbent, Business Owner/Engineer
As the school board vice president, I am able to see past the rhetoric of educational insiders to protect our students and schools. I favor classroom reform, school choice, local control, program innovation and fair taxation. I represent the communities of Ladera Ranch, Las Flores, Wagon Wheel, Coto de Caza, Trabuco, eastern San Juan Capistrano, Sendero and Esencia, most of which pay Mello-Roos taxes that supported new school construction.
In 2012, I promised never to vote for a tax increase. I vigorously oppose CUSD’s $889 million bond, Measure M, on the November ballot that will triple-tax Mello-Roos areas. It unfairly burdens younger communities. I will guard against abuse of this enormous $1.8 billion local tax if it should pass. I recommend a “no” vote.
Since 2013, as a board member I have championed fairness in management of Mello-Roos tax districts. This has produced tax reductions of $81 million, while ensuring that CUSD’s credit rating remains solid.
I will continue work to open new schools to serve Esencia and surrounding areas on time. These projects, as well as expansion of San Juan Hills High School are underway, and their funding is unaffected by Measure M.
I am a parent, computer engineer, active business owner and founder of a successful nonprofit school serving 6-12 grade students with autism. I seek to raise quality of education for all students including those with disabilities, and increase enrichment, vocational and sports opportunities in our schools.
I am proud of my reputation as the most accessible and responsive member of our school board. The duty of a member to help families to work with our enormous organization to resolve individual problems for students is one I take most seriously.
Reelect me, Jim Reardon, to the Capistrano Unified school board.

Leaders at CUSD promote the district as being the top performing school district in California, when it ranks 31st in math and 23rd in English. This presents an opportunity to encourage continuous improvement. We can do better!
Volunteering is my passion. Most recently, I led a citizen advocacy group. Together we fought for Talega taxpayers who CUSD was overtaxing by $2.3 million annually and remedied the abuses, saving $60 million over the life of our Mello-Roos payments.
If you elect me, I will hold the district accountable to all of San Clemente and ensure the responsible use of tax dollars, while minimizing consulting costs so more money can be spent in the classroom. I will be accessible to you and care about your concerns.
I serve on Assemblyman Bill Brough’s Education Advisory Committee. I’ve been involved in a parent-led effort to bring quality school choice to the southernmost part of CUSD where none currently exists. Our number one goal must be to provide a quality education to the diverse children of our community.
I’ve attended school board meetings for three consecutive years, speaking on behalf of parents/taxpayers at many meetings. We need new leadership who value the public’s voice. I oppose CUSD’s billion dollar bond because of the absence of specificity, haphazard compilation and lack of assurance that the projects will ever be completed.
Our chance to hit the reset button on this school board is Nov. 8. Reject the status quo and vote for new leadership.

Patricia Holloway, Retired Business Owner
For 30 years I’ve lived, worked and volunteered in San Clemente. I’ve raised funds for our nonprofits including Casa Romantica and the Marine Monument. I understand the culture of our beach-oriented community that values our ocean, historic buildings, downtown, local businesses and education. A healthy community must include strong public schools that prepare our young people for their futures.
I’m running to represent San Clemente on the school board so I can work to strengthen our schools, build trust between our community and CUSD, and be a responsible steward of taxpayer dollars. When I’m elected, I will form a San Clemente Education Council—consisting of parents, educators and community members—to increase transparency and local input regarding district decision-making, budgets and bonds. To address the unique needs of military dependents, I’ll create a permanent CUSD/military liaison position.
Because I know children have different educational needs, I support school choice. I’ll fight for San Clemente students’ fair access to CUSD’s language immersion programs. I’ll expand our fine career technical education programs for those who elect not to attend college or who want to explore post-college careers. To support high achievement, I’ll be sure our students are educated in 21st-century facilities with up-to-date technology.
I’ve demonstrated commitment to education as a substitute teacher and PTA president, and by introducing arts and education programs at Casa Romantica, Shorecliffs and Las Palmas schools.  I graduated from UC Davis and earned my master’s from UC Berkeley.
As proud parents of a SCHS graduate, my husband, Jim, and I love that our hometown high school has been a center of excellence in academics, sports and the arts for over 50 years. I’ll work to continue that tradition and ask for your vote.

Timothy Everson,9/9/2016 13:07,"On Wednesday evening, the Iowa State student government passed a resolution against Brigham Young University joining the Big 12 according to an art icle from the Iowa State Daily.
Iowa State SGA senators state, ""BYU's discriminatory policies and practices are inconsistent with the values of the Big 12,"" as the reason behind the resolution.
The resolution was passed 21-6 with the six senators in opposition citing freedom of speech issues.
Iowa State SGA plans on sending the resolution to the presidents of all the Big 12 Universities, including Kansas State Interim President General Richard Myers, and Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby.
The Cougars are thought to be high on the list of candidates for Big 12 expansion.
The Mormon university based out of Provo, Utah has come under fire multiple times this year for issues involving their honor code.
In April, a former BYU student reported that she was suspended from the University after reporting her rape according to a New York Times article. The reason for her suspension was for violation of the honor code after admitting to school officials that she had been coerced into an earlier sexual encounter with the same student who had raped her and that she had used LSD the night she was raped.
In August, 25 different LGBT groups signed a letter penned by Athlete Ally, a non-profit, pro-LGBT group, wrote to Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby, urging the conference not to consider BYU for expansion according to an article by Fox Sports.
BYU's honor code specifically states: ""Homosexual behavior is inappropriate and violates the Honor Code. Homosexual behavior includes not only sexual relations between members of the same sex, but all forms of physical intimacy that give expression to homosexual feelings.""

Ryan Reed,9/9/2016 13:07,"TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin evades a tackle from Kansas State then-sophomore defensive back Kaleb Prewett as he rushes for a first down in the fourth quarter of the Wildcats' close 52-45 loss to TCU on Oct. 10, 2015, in Bill Snyder Family Stadium. (File Photo by Parker Robb | The Collegian)
After a thrilling first week of college football that included a double overtime shootout in Austin, a three touchdown comeback in Orlando and a massive upset by South Alabama over Mississippi State in Starkville, it's time to get ready for this week's matchups. Here are some of the best games to look out for.
BYU vs. Utah
The Holy War is back. The Utah Utes will be hosting the Brigham Young University Cougars Saturday at Rice-Eccles Stadium in Salt Lake City, Utah, with a kickoff time of 7:30 p.m. EST.
The Utes claim an all-time 58-34-4 record against the Cougars, but the Cougars claim that the Utes only lead 55-31-4. The reason for the difference is the Utes count six games played against Brigham Young Academy, BYU's original name from 1875-1903, but BYU considers their first matchup to be in 1922, which BYU considers to be its inaugural season.
The Cougars come into the encounter after an 18-16 victory over the Arizona Wildcats on a last-second field goal from kicker Jake Oldroyd last weekend in Glendale. Most of the Cougars' yards on offense came from running back Jamaal Williams, who logged 29 carries and rushed for 162 yards. The BYU defense is also a force to be reckoned with. After questions were being asked about BYU's switch to a 4-3 defense, the Cougars responded to the critics by sacking Arizona quarterback Anu Solomon four times and had eight tackles for a loss.
The Utes head into the matchup after a 24-0 victory over Southern Utah. Despite not winning by the margin that the Utes were hoping for, there were still some positives to take away. Quarterback Troy Williams threw for 272 yards and two touchdowns. Plus, the Utah defense stuffed Southern Utah to only 158 offensive yards. Safety Marcus Williams recorded a forced fumbled, a fumble recovery and an interception. Look forward to a heated battle in Salt Lake City.
Virginia Tech vs. No. 17 Tennessee
This game could be really interesting, especially when you take the venue into consideration. Already labeled as ""The Battle at Bristol,"" this game will be taking place at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tennessee. The current record for attendance at a college football game is 115,109, which was set back in 2013 when Michigan hosted Notre Dame at the ""Big House."" This matchup is expected to attract more than 150,000 people.
The Tennessee Volunteers enter this matchup with a series lead against the Hokies of 5-3-0. The Volunteers suffered a scare last weekend, as underdog Appalachian State managed to scrape its way into overtime, only losing 20-13. Senior quarterback Joshua Dobbs will be looking to provide better decision-making this week after his struggles against the Appalachian State pass rush. Junior running back Jalen Hurd will be anticipating a good day after his 110 yards on the ground against Appalachian State, along with the game-winning fumble recovery in the end zone.
The Virginia Tech Hokies had an ugly win themselves last weekend as they toppled the Liberty Flames 36-13. Though on paper the scoreline doesn't look bad, the Hokies lost four fumbles to the FCS competition and only led 17-13 with 24 seconds left in the second quarter. New head coach Justin Fuente will be looking to quiet the critics as this is his first real test since taking over in Blacksburg, Virginia after Frank Beamer, Hokies coach of 29 seasons, retired.
Arkansas vs. No. 15 TCU
Despite the scary No. 15 ranking that TCU has attached to its name this week, Arkansas should have a feeling heading into Fort Worth that maybe it can pull this one off. Neither of these two sides looked convincing in their first week victories. The Arkansas Razorbacks hold a 43-23-2 series lead over the Horned Frogs but the last time these two played was all the way back in 1991, when Arkansas just edged out TCU 22-21.
The Horned Frogs are looking to improve on last week's performance because despite winning 59-41, giving up 461 yards and 41 points to the South Dakota State Jackrabbits is outright terrible. Replacing last year's phenom Trevone Boykin, quarterback Kenny Hill wants to continue his form from last week. Though he didn't start too well, he finished the game with 439 yards in the air and two passing touchdowns, along with three rushing scores.
The Razorbacks narrowly edged Louisiana Tech last week, 21-20. Keon Hatcher was huge for Arkansas with his 12.7 yards per target and 85 percent success rate, finishing with six catches for 89 yards on seven attempts. However, if Arkansas wants to win this game, it needs to revive its running game. Rawleigh Williams III led the Razorbacks, producing only 96 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries with an average of 4 yards per carry. With that being said, the Arkansas defense should be hitting the Horned Frogs' offensive line hard. Anticipate a close one in Waco. The game kicks off at 7 p.m. EST.

News roundup: GOP members vow to continue Clinton probes even if she wins presidency Tribune Political Reporters First Published 31 minutes ago • Updated 30 minutes ago Share This Article GOP members vow to continue Clinton probes even if she wins presidency. Utah Debate Commission says no third-party candidates met threshold. Happy Friday. Top GOP lawmakers on both sides of the Capitol are vowing that their investigations of Hillary Clinton will continue even if she wins the White House in November. House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz of Utah wants answers on the deletion of Clinton emails he says may constitute ""destruction of evidence."" House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes of California is working on a bill to pull the security clearance of anyone who broke rules governing confidential information. Senate Republicans have their own ideas for investigations. [ Politico ] Topping the news: The Utah Debate Commission poll showed no third-party candidates meeting the threshold to participate in local debates. The study also showed Republicans leading by a landslide in each race, including the thought-to-be-close race between Rep. Mia Love and Doug Owens. [ Trib ] [ Fox13 ] [ UtahPolicy ] -> More Latino immigrants have been leaving the United States than entering it since the 2009 recession, according to a Pew Research Center study released Thursday. But a growing Utah economy, especially in the construction sector, is starting to draw them back in. [ Trib ] [ DNews ] [ KUTV ] -> Utah political and religious leaders broke ground together for a $17 million rodeo arena inside the State Fairpark Thursday. The project is expected to be finished next July in time for the Days of ‘47 Rodeo. [ Trib ] [ Fox13 ] Tweets of the day: From @ RonanFarrow : ""Of course Aleppo is trending because a politician was dumb, not because it’s ground zero of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world."" From @ LisaVikingstad : ""The @nytimes misidentified 2 cities in Syria while criticizing Gary Johnson for blanking on Aleppo."" From @ ObsoleteDogma : ""Who among us hasn’t accidentally gone on Putin’s propaganda TV network?"" Happy Birthday: today to Salt Lake County’s Rob Jeppsen, and on Saturday to Justin Wiley (the new father to Asa Brooks Wiley) and Marco Diaz. Tune In: Tribune reporters Emma Penrod, Kyle Goon and Thomas Burr as well as government and politics editor Dan Harrie join The Salt Lake Tribune’s Benjamin Wood to talk about the week’s top stories, including college football and Utah’s water quality. In other news: The State Records Committee granted an appeal at a Thursday hearing, requiring Orem and Provo police departments to supply The Salt Lake Tribune with a list of all the instances BYU Police accessed their records database with certain information redacted. The list will assist The Tribune’s investigation into mishandling of sexual assault cases at the university. [ Trib ] -> A State Department of Health report released Thursday said that 555 Utahns committed suicide in 2014, the seventh highest number in the nation. [ Trib ] [ DNews ] [ ABC4 ] [ KUER ] -> The Utah Transit Authority won a much sought after $4.27 million federal grant on Thursday. The money will be used to replace 15-year-old buses with newer and more environmentally friendly models. [ Trib ] -> Former UTA employee J. Michael Clara was denied his court request for release of records that he says would show he was fired for trying to stop the agency from building unsafe and illegal bus shelters. [ Trib ] -> Utah’s reservoirs are emptier than usual, and officials are hoping for a snowy winter to make up the difference. [ Trib ] -> Bob Bernick says Trump won’t hurt down-ballot Republicans in Utah even though he isn’t popular there. [ UtahPolicy ] Bernick and Bryan Schott also suggest some advice to Gov. Gary Herbert: Stop talking about Trump. [ UtahPolicy ] -> Lisa Shaffer, the woman who has been acting as interim director of Salt Lake City’s Department of Public Services for the last five months, is officially appointed to the position. [ Trib ] [ DNews ] -> Paul Rolly muses on the treatment of Native Americans, both derogatory and thoughtfully kind. [ Trib ] -> Pat Bagley pokes fun at the chummy relationship Donald Trump is promoting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [ Trib ] Nationally: A Donald Trump interview with Larry King was broadcast on state-owned Russian television network RT America Thursday night. The Trump campaign responded that it wasn’t aware where the footage would be shown. [ WaPost ] [ CNN ] -> Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson, working toward the 15 percent polling threshold to be included in the debates, may have wounded his prospects when he had to ask an MSNBC interviewer what Aleppo (the center of the Syrian refugee crisis) is. [ NYTimes ] [ Politico ] [ Time ] [ WaPost ] [ NBCNews ] -> Hillary Clinton spoke to the National Baptist Convention about her religion on Thursday, pointedly avoiding talking about Donald Trump. [ WaPost ] [ NYTimes ] -> Trump stopped to campaign on Thursday at a Cleveland charter school with failing marks from the Ohio Department of Education. Trump pitched his plan to budget $20 billion as president to aid students in switching from underperforming public schools to higher quality private and charter schools. [ WaPost ] [ NYTimes ] Where are they? Rep. Jason Chaffetz hits an Oversight hearing on FEMA response in Louisiana, votes, and flies to Utah. Rep. Chris Stewart votes and heads to a House Intelligence Committee meeting and a Congressional 9/11 remembrance ceremony. Rep. Mia Love attends meetings about HR 5188 Graduate Medical Education Bill, votes, catches up with staff, and flies home to Utah. Gov. Gary Herbert heads to the Utah Ethical Business Awards, Utah Valley Homebuilders Association, Boards and Commissions meeting and Teacher of the Year banquet. Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox has no public events. State Auditor John Dougall meets with management at the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. President Barack Obama returns to the White House. Got a tip?

So rather than bore you (anymore) with a month in the life of a busy author who has barely had time to smell the fresh air, I decided to dig through my old files to find an outtake from Farm Fresh to share with you. Farm Fresh has been on my mind since I got the crazy idea to create a mug in a new Zazzle store, all because I wanted one to give away as a prize at GRL for the Daring Author Trivia Fun Fair and maybe have one at home for my morning coffee. So yeah, I made this!
Farm Fresh is now in all your fave bookstores in both ebook and paperback too. So if you've been waiting for it to come off KU and get into other bookstores beside Amazon, it's available wide and far.
And now onto the scene. This was cut because I needed to get to Jude and Hudson talking at the farmers market quicker rather than allowing this little scene between Hudson and Charlie to slow the pacing. I still like it because it shows Hudson being a bit more playful than and more in his element before Jude moves to the commune and turns his world upside down. Oh, and it's unedited, so forgive the errors.
Hudson headed down the three mile dirt-and-grass driveway toward the gravel road that would eventually take him to the paved highway. Soupy fog hovering near the thick forest made the evergreens look blue-black, but it eventually thinned, greening everything up. By the time he arrived on the Portland State University’s campus, the sun had burned nearly all the moisture away.
The next hour was filled with the well-practiced routine of unloading the truck, setting up tables, the canopies, and then making sure everything was weighted down before anything eye-pleasing could happen. He got busy making sure signage and produce were in the right spots, and Charlie arrived about thirty minutes before the market was to open. His arms were loaded down with all the extras that couldn’t fit in the first truck. They took care arranging everything so it was all easily seen by customers.
“Did the co-op take all the honey you brought?” Hudson asked.
“Most of it. I have a case in the van.”
“Let’s sell it.”
Once eight-thirty hit, the Kaleidoscope Gardens stand was packed. That’s why Charlie always came to help out on Saturday mornings after he’d done his early deliveries of goods to stores. Hudson was glad for the extra hand after part one of Charlie’s chores were done.
As usual, they were swamped, answering questions, juggling cash, and providing in-depth information about their produce. There were a lot of familiar faces but new ones as well. When the traffic slowed, Charlie and Hudson slumped on the opened tailgate of the truck, exhausted from all the people time.
“What do you think?” Charlie asked, pointing to a guy with a thick, bushy beard and hair pulled back into a man bun. “Vegan, vegetarian, or meat eater?” Hudson scrutinized the guy, from his flannel shirt down to his cream-colored canvas shoes with jute soles.
“Vegan.”
“We’ll see,” Charlie taunted.
The guy took a few steps closer to the Kaleidoscope Gardens stall, paused, and then walked over to the eggs. Charlie raised a brow as the guy asked, “Are your chicken’s free-range?”
“Yes,” Hudson said, standing to greet the man with a smile. “And we’ve got happy hens because of it.”
“Great.”
After the guy had paid and gone, Charlie turned to Hudson to say, “You owe me a blow job. I knew he wasn’t vegan.”
“How?”
“Did you not notice the leather bracelet he wore?”
“You’re too good at this game.”
“Yep. I’m special, that way. Welp.” Charlie slapped his thickly muscled thighs with his meaty hands. “I’m gonna go. I promised I’d pick everyone up sooner rather than later today. They should be done with all their errands, I think.”
“Thanks for the help, brother.” Hudson embraced Charlie. They discreetly kissed each other on the neck, then stepped back. The look in Charlie’s eyes spoke of the same things Hudson was feeling: he wished they could openly kiss and touch in the way they did at home, but they knew they couldn’t. They had to keep up the professionalism for the image of the Gardens and not let the reality or their way of life to be openly advertised.
Few knew the full truth about Kaleidoscope Gardens. Only people who took the time to seek out more in-depth information discovered they were a commune where everyone belonged to the queer community. They didn’t hide that part. It was one of the ideals which had brought them together—to live in a place free from judgment over sexual identity or expression—but they didn’t advertise it on their business card or the back of their truck.
What they hid was that they celebrated sex openly. Living freely, screwing openly, and farming organically wasn’t a slogan that would sell more produce, so they all restrained themselves while out in public representing the Gardens.
Hudson contented himself by gently pressing their lips together before Charlie took off.

Sexy and complex, Chris’ writing delivers the stories that touch readers’ hearts. Born and raised in Louisiana, Chris worked as an electrical engineer before climbing off the corporate ladder and becoming a full-time writer. Chris resides in Louisiana, where the gumbo is hot…but the men are hotter.

[/gravityforms][gravityforms action=""conditional"" merge_tag=""Posy Roberts"" condition=""contains"" value=""Christopher Koehler""] Christopher Koehler learned to read late (or so his teachers thought) but never looked back. It was not, however, until he was nearly done with grad school in the history of science that he realized that he needed to spend his life writing and not on the publish-or-perish treadmill. At risk of being thought frivolous, he found that academic writing sucked all the fun out of putting pen to paper.
Christopher is also something of a hothouse flower. Inside of almost unreal conditions he thrives to set the results of his imagination free, and for most of his life he has been lucky enough to be surrounded by people who encouraged both that tendency and the writing. Chief among them is his long-suffering husband of twenty-two years and counting.
When it comes to writing, Christopher follows Anne Lamott’s advice: ""You own everything that happened to you. Tell your stories. If people wanted you to write warmly about them, they should have behaved better.” So while he writes fiction, at times he ruthlessly mines his past for character traits and situations. Reality is far stranger than fiction.
Christopher loves many genres of fiction and nonfiction, but he's especially fond of romances, because it is in them that human emotions and relations, at least most of the ones fit to be discussed publicly, are laid bare.
Writing is his passion and his life, but when Christopher is not doing that, he's an at-home dad and oarsman with a slightly disturbing interest in manners and other ways people behave badly.

Clare took the pen name London from the city where she lives, loves, and writes. A lone, brave female in a frenetic, testosterone-fuelled family home, she juggles her writing with the weekly wash, waiting for the far distant day when she can afford to give up her day job as an accountant. She’s written in many genres and across many settings, with novels and short stories published both online and in print. She says she likes variety in her writing while friends say she’s just fickle, but as long as both theories spawn good fiction, she’s happy.  Most of her work features male/male romance and drama with a healthy serving of physical passion, as she enjoys both reading and writing about strong, sympathetic and sexy characters.
Clare currently has several novels sulking at that tricky chapter 3 stage and plenty of other projects in mind . . . she just has to find out where she left them in that frenetic, testosterone-fuelled family home.

Originally trained as a Biology teacher, Daniel was unsure what to do with his life until he came across fanfiction for his favourite anime and decided to have a go at writing his own. To this day, he still cringes at the memory of the cheesy terminology he used.
When not writing, Daniel enjoys a variety of activities, including running, going to the gym, bondage, watching anime, and the mass-slaying of virtual monsters in the hopes of receiving epic loot. One day, he hopes to become a werepanther and invent chocolate that can be eaten all day without making you fat.

She wrote for pure enjoyment for the next three decades before discovering LiveJournal and a wonderful group of supportive fanfiction writers, who after gifting her with a """"Best New Author"""" Award encouraged her to try her hand at original gay fiction.
Born and raised in southern California, Diana moved to the Pacific Northwest after losing a beloved spouse to AIDS in 1995. She lives in eastern Washington with four obnoxious cats, near her two wonderful adult children.
[/gravityforms][gravityforms action=""conditional"" merge_tag=""Posy Roberts"" condition=""contains"" value=""Dorien Grey""] If it is possible to have a split personality without being schizophrenic, Dorien Grey qualifies. When long-time book and magazine editor Roger Margason chose the pseudonym ""Dorien Grey” for his first book, it set off a chain of circumstances which has led to the comfortable division of labor and responsibility. Roger has charge of day-to-day existence, freeing Dorien—with the help of Roger’s fingers—to write. It has reached the point where Roger merely sits back and reads the stories Dorien brings forth on the computer screen.
It’s not as though Roger has not had an uninteresting life of his own. Two years into college, he left to join the Naval Aviation Cadet program. Washing out after a year, he spent the rest of his brief military career on an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean at the height of the cold war. The journal he kept of his time in the military, in the form of letters home, honed his writing skills and provided him with a wealth of experiences to draw from in his future writing. These letters will be appearing in book form shortly.
Returning to Northern Illinois University after service, he graduated with a B.A. in English, and embarked on a series of jobs which worked him into the editing field. While working for a Los Angeles publishing house, he was instrumental in establishing a division exclusively for the publication of gay paperbacks and magazines, of which he became editor. He moved on to edit a leading L.A. based international gay men's magazine.
Tiring of earthquakes, brush fires, mud slides, and riots, he returned to the Midwest, where Dorien emerged, full-blown, like Venus from the sea. They’ve been inseparable (and interchangeable) ever since.
He . . . and Dorien of course…moved back to Chicago in 2006, where they now devote full time to writing. Author of the popular Dick Hardesty Mystery series, the Elliott Smith (paranormal) Mystery, the stand-alone western/romance/adventure novel, Calico, plus the non fiction A World Ago: A Navy Man's Letters Home, 1954-1956; Short Circuits: A Life in Blogs, and a book of poems (Dreams of a Calico Mouse), Dorien is in the process of having all his books done as audiobooks.
But for a greater insight into the """"real person"""" behind Dorien Grey, the curious are invited to check out his website (http://www.doriengrey.com), which includes the first chapter of any or all of his books for free, and his various blogs: Dorien Grey and Me (http://www.doriengreyandme.com) and A Life in Photos                 (http://www.doriengreyphotolife.blogspot.com) among them.

nataliegreaveslaw,9/9/2016 13:36,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about a condition that we all face at different points in our lives--loneliness.  Losing family members and friends, having kids grow up and even move away, it’s all quite a change.  Sometimes I don’t like change.
“Pssst.  Natalie.  This is supposed to be a post about what brings you joy, remember?”
Prepare yourself for some “ugly cry” truth here.  I’ve struggled a bit lately to feel joy.
Here’s the thing, there has to be opposition in all things.
""For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my firstborn in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.""[1]
As a mortal, it is important to face challenges and make choices without our Heavenly Father’s constant presence we once enjoyed (see D&C 58:26–28). Even the Savior suffered alone, that he could know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities (Alma 7:12).
If we look at the Topical Guide for “Loneliness”, we see cross references for  “Brotherhood and Sisterhood ; Fellowshipping ; Holy Ghost, Mission of.”
Isn’t that interesting?  The Holy Ghost was given to us precisely to help dispel the loneliness that Heavenly Father knew we would feel.  Of course, he also gave us each other, which is why the Topical Guide includes “brotherhood” and “sisterhood” as well.
We are promised in the scriptures,
“I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you"" (John 14:18) and, ""I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee."" (Heb. 13:5).
When we feel like we are wandering in the desert all alone, we have to make a choice in how we deal with it.  The bad example that I sometimes set is one of self-pity, of criticism, of anger, of unjust blame, of depression, and of discontent and a general attitude of “why me?” These thoughts do not lead us me out of loneliness.
Elder Hales said,
“When we are marred spiritually or physically, our first reaction is to withdraw into the dark shadows of depression, to blot out hope and joy—the light of life which comes from knowing we are living the commandments of our Father in heaven. This withdrawal will ultimately lead us to rebellion against those who would like to be our friends, those who can help us most, even our family. But worst of all, we finally reject ourselves.  Those who are alone and lonely should not retreat to the sanctuary of their private thoughts and chambers. Such retreat will ultimately lead them into the darkening influence of the adversary, which leads to despondency, loneliness, frustration, and to thinking of themselves as worthless.""[2]
Instead, the right way to dig ourselves out of the deep dry pit of loneliness is to engage in meaningful activities and exercise some patience.
Elder Richard G. Scott once commented on the role of personal initiative in overcoming feelings of loneliness and of being excluded:
“The social and sport activities [of my youth] left me feeling alone and unwanted. It was not until a lot later in life that I realized it was largely my fault. I have since learned that one cannot demand love and respect or require that the bonds of friendship and appreciation be extended as an unearned right. These blessings must be earned. They come from personal merit. Sincere concern for others, selfless service, and worthy example qualify one for such respect. All my rationalization that others had formed select groups and knowingly ruled out my participation was largely a figment of my imagination. Had I practiced correct principles, I need not have felt alone.”[3]
Peace doesn’t always come immediately, and it doesn’t always come in a rush.  Sometimes the light gradually grows brighter like a sunrise rather than the flip of a light switch.
We can also search through our feelings to find the gratitude in our circumstances.
An 88-year-old sister who is almost blind and completely homebound said,
“I talk to the Lord as if he were right here with me. . . The lonelier I get, the closer I get to the Lord. Being alone gives me an opportunity to be quiet, and in my quietness I seek the inspiration that the Lord has offered me.”[4]
Now, as real as all of this has felt to me recently, there are so many who are feeling loneliness that is much deeper and broader than what I’ve felt.  A sweet and faithful older sister in my ward just passed away very suddenly.  My heart hurts for her husband as he mourns her loss.  His sacrifice puts my very temporary loneliness in perspective.
And yet, even death is only temporary because of Christ.  Ultimately, even if we cannot change our circumstances, we must remember that this is just but a small moment, because our Savior has walked this way before us.
[gallery ids=""2321,2322"" type=""columns""]
“. . because Jesus walked such a long, lonely path utterly alone, we do not have to do so. His solitary journey brought great company for our little version of that path—the merciful care of our Father in Heaven, the unfailing companionship of this Beloved Son, the consummate gift of the Holy Ghost, angels in heaven, family members on both sides of the veil, prophets and apostles, teachers, leaders, friends. All of these and more have been given as companions for our mortal journey because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the Restoration of His gospel.”[5]
Now, there just might be someone out there who is really, really struggling and may have even had thoughts of suicide.  It just so happens that the Church launched a new website this week.  Even if that isn't you, check this website out so that you can be informed and maybe help someone else along your path:  Suicide Prevention Site.  It has a great video and some good questions and answers.  If you really knew, you might be surprised how close the reality and impact of suicide is to someone in your circle of friends.  Now, a website is not a substitute for medical and professional help.  Please reach out. You are worth it.  There is no one else like you in the world.  You are needed.
For those like me, who maybe are just feeling a little more down than usual, what are we going to do about it?  How am I going to find that which brings joy, even when it feels a little hard?
I’m going to keep trudging.  I’m going to keep studying my scriptures and words of the prophets.  I’m going to keep trying my best to love my family, to help people, and to do my best to keep my head up and realize that Heavenly Father loves me, that life is good, and that I have much to be grateful for, in an effort to find and embrace the joy that is just waiting for me if I choose to feel it.

Quorum Hotels & Resorts, a leading independent provider of hospitality management solutions has announced it assumed management of hotels located in Lexington, KY, Provo, UT and Columbia, SC during the last 90 days. The Hilton Lexington Suites (174 keys) is one of the closest hotels to the University of Kentucky and will be converted to an Embassy Suites upon completion of significant renovations over the next 12-16 months. The Courtyard Provo (99 keys) enjoys a strategic location next door to Brigham Young University. The Hyatt Place Columbia/Downtown/The Vista (130 keys) is the newest hotel in downtown Columbia and is located within Columbia's premier art and entertainment district, The Vista, and a short walkto the University of South Carolina.

Ben Whitehead (noreply@blogger.com),9/9/2016 14:00,"
After what was billed as the greatest opening weekend ever, college football enters cupcake week. Opening weekend produced some real exciting games, lots of upset, and left us wanting more. Unfortunately, the second week of the season will be a bit of a let down.

There are no Top 25 showdowns. Some decent games are on tap, including a few rivalries, but don't expect to be tied to your La-Z-Boy all day Saturday. Let's get to the picks!

2016 BENched PTF Record:  9-3 (.750 win %) *Rankings below reflect the AP Top 25 

Saturday 

Penn State at Pittsburgh  (Line: Pittsburgh -4.5)
Pitt-Penn State Rivalry  (Penn State leads 50-42-4) 
This rivalry is finally renewed after a 16-year hiatus. Neither team is coming off impressive wins in the first week, as the Nittany Lions beat Kent State 33-13 and the Panthers knocked off Villanova 28-7. James Conner's return was heart-warming. He scored two touchdowns in his first action since taking on and defeating cancer. Should be a dandy to kickoff the day. Despite the game being played in Pittsburgh and in an NFL stadium, the crowd should be pro-Penn State and the atmosphere tremendous.
Pittsburgh 23, Penn State 17 

Troy at No. 2 Clemson  (Line: Clemson -36)
For the third straight game, Clemson takes on an opponent from the state of Alabama. For the second straight week, the Tigers face off against a former Clemson defensive coordinator. Returning to the friendly confines of Death Valley for the first time in five games, Clemson aims to get its offense rolling against a scrappy, but overwhelmed bunch from Troy. This may be closer than the 36-point spread, but it won't be close enough to be worrisome for Tiger fans.
Clemson 38, Troy 17 

Kentucky at Florida  (Line: Florida -16.5)
The Gators led UMass 10-7 in the fourth quarter before pulling away 24-7, while the Wildcats blew a 35-10 halftime lead and lost to Southern Miss 44-35. Florida has a 29-game win streak over Kentucky, a streak that likely won't be broken this season in The Swamp.
Florida 28, Kentucky 10 

South Carolina at Mississippi State (Line: Mississippi State -7)
The Gamecocks opened the Will Muschamp era with a 13-10 win over Vanderbilt. South Carolina trailed 10-0 at halftime, but Perry Orth found some rhythm in the second half, enough to pick up the road win. Meanwhile, Mississippi State was left searching for answers after blowing a 20-7 lead against South Alabama, then missing a short field goal late that led to a 21-20 win for the Jaguars. The Bulldogs being a seven-point favorite is either telling that Vegas still believes in the Bulldogs, or what they think of the Gamecocks.
Mississippi State 27, South Carolina 17 

Arkansas at No. 15 TCU (Line: TCU -7.5)
This one will have eyes all over it. TCU was slow out of the gate against South Dakota State, ultimately winning 59-41. Kenny Hill seemed to grasp the Horned Frog offense, passing for 439 yards and two touchdowns, and rushing for three more scores. Arkansas struggled to put away Louisiana Tech, needing a fourth quarter TD to win 21-20. Expect the Hogs to stick with their ground and pound approach. If they get too far behind early on, it could be tough trying to play catch-up with the high-flying Frogs.
TCU 44, Arkansas 27 

Iowa State at No. 16 Iowa (Line: Iowa -15)
Battle for the Cy-Hawk Trophy (Iowa leads 41-22) 
Iowa returned a lot from the 2015 squad that went undefeated in the regular season, but faltered in the Big Ten Championship Game and the Rose Bowl. The Hawkeyes have another easy schedule that should allow them to win double-digit games again. Iowa State on the other hand is breaking in a new coach, as Matt Campbell made his way to Ames from Toledo. His debut was forgettable, though. The Cyclones fell to Northern Iowa in Week 1. A rivalry game can always produce an interesting result, but the only thing interesting about this one will be seeing the trophy on the field.
Iowa 40, Iowa State 17 
BYU quarterback Taysom Hill is back for one more season.
Hill looks to lead his Cougars to a big win at Utah in the Holy War.

Holy War (Utah leads 58-34-4) 
It's not on the level of Alabama-Auburn, Ohio State-Michigan or Oklahoma-Texas, but there is no love lost between BYU and Utah. The Utes rolled out to a 35-0 lead on BYU in the Las Vegas Bowl in December before holding on for a 35-28 win. Fresh off a shutout of Southern Utah, the Utes aim for their second win over BYU in three games. BYU opened the season with an 18-16 win over Arizona at University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale to kick off the Kalani Sitake era. Taysom Hill is back for the Cougars and that's a good thing for college football fans. Hill's mobility and toughness could lead BYU to an upset here. In fact, I'll pick it.
BYU 23, Utah 20 

North Carolina at Illinois (Line: North Carolina -7.5)
The Tar Heels fell flat after holding a 10-point lead on Georgia in Atlanta, ultimately being run over by Nick Chubb. Good news, UNC fans, Illinois does not have a Chubb on the roster, or anything like him for that matter. Lovie Smith led the Fighting Illini to a 52-3 whooping over Murray State. North Carolina presents a different challenge with offensive weapons all over the field including running back Elijah Hood. Last year, Hood had 129 yards and a TD run in a 48-14 Tar Heel win over Illinois in Chapel Hill. Something tells me he has a big day in Champaign.
North Carolina 37, Illinois 24 

Virginia Tech vs. No. 17 Tennessee (Line: Tennessee -11) - at Bristol Motor Speedway in Bristol, Tenn. 
Over 150,000 folks will pack Bristol Motor Speedway for the most anticipated, but too far away to see from the stands game in college football history. Bristol, Tenn., splits the two campuses and this game has been in the works for years. Tennessee looked ugly in its season opener against Appalachian State, earning a come-from-behind 20-13 win in overtime. The Hokies struggled early in their opener against Liberty, but topped the Flames 36-13. Tennessee, on paper, has more talent. There could be many storylines out of this one, including the amount of fans, the noise level or lack of, the sight lines, the depth perception of the players, etc. Still, the Vols probably get it done.
Tennessee 24, Virginia Tech 13 

Texas Tech at Arizona State  (Line: Arizona State -2.5)
The first of many late night starts that are actually pretty good games comes to us from Tempe, Ariz. Patrick Mahomes might be the best under-the-radar quarterback in college football. Most people expect the Red Raiders QBs to have huge stats because of the system. Mahomes, however, possesses a power arm, accuracy and mobility that sets him apart from previous Texas Tech signal callers. Arizona State also has a high-flying offense, so expect a lot of points in this one.
Texas Tech 45, Arizona State 38 

Washington State at Boise State  (Line: Boise State -10.5)
Mike Leach and his band of pirates, er, Cougars head to The Blue"" for the home opener for Boise State. Luke Falk, like Mahomes an unheralded but very good quarterback, will try to duplicate the 2015 season in which he threw for over 4500 yards and 38 TDs to just eight interceptions. The Cougars also lost to an FCS school to open that season, but went on to win nine games and defeated Miami in the Sun Bowl. Boise State has a force at running back, though. Jeremy McNichols leads the Broncos offense and could be trouble for Washington State, which gave up 45 points to Eastern Washington.
Boise State 52, Washington State 31 

Cal at San Diego State  (Line: San Diego State -7)
San Diego State is a sleeper pick for the top Group of 5 team to emerge unscathed. A touchdown favorite, the Aztecs are hoping to upend a Cal team who have already had an interesting start to the season. The Bears scored 51 points to beat Hawai'i in the opener two weeks ago in Australia, but spent the last week overcoming jet-lag. Now, they head south to take on a team looking for a season-defining win.
San Diego State 41, Cal 31 

Virginia at No. 24 Oregon  (Line: Oregon -24.5)
This late-nighter won't be pretty. FCS Richmond took down Virginia last week and Oregon looks to be as potent on offense as ever. The Ducks don't have a Marcus Mariota, but they do have Royce Freeman, the best running back you haven't heard of yet. You can head to bed at halftime of this one, if the game isn't already out of hand by then.
Oregon 63, Virginia 10

Basketball freethrow shooting: The importance of the ""conscious"" and ""subconscious"" mind in improving free throw shooting:
Once Upon a time there were three brothers who all lived in the same complex. Their names were 'Conscious', Subconscious' and 'Unconscious'. These guys play 'mind games'. Obviously there must be some interaction between the nerves and corresponding systems of nerves. The Cerebrospinal is the organ of the conscious mind and the sympathetic nervous system is the organ of the subconscious. The cerebrospinal provides the avenue by which we get conscious perception from the physical senses and maintain control of body movements. This nervous system resides in the brain's center. The Sympathetic system sets up shop in a mass of ganglions at the back of the stomach and is called the Solar Plexus and is the avenue for the mental activity which supports unconsciously the vital body functions like heart beat, blood flow, blinking etc. They are all very receptive to light and knowledge as well as one's environment and the Universality of man and his connection to God.
The impact that the subconscious mind has on the body is tremendous. It could be considered a multi-tasker. It is responsible for our hard drive or the memory storage bank, it is from here that we get our inspiration, it channels our thoughts, tastes and many other intricate tasks like controlling our heart beat, blood flow, cellular growth, bone growth, formation of muscle and nerve tissues, blinking etc. Almost all the physical processes that we never think about that helps sustain our daily lives. These are definitely constant underlying activities that are all in production each and every time you shoot a basketball and you definitely don't want to have any conscious thought focused on any subconscious activity. You will have enough trouble concentrating on just a couple, simple conscious tasks during a free throw attempt. Makes you wonder what really controls your life.
The subconscious while controlling all regular bodily functions mentioned above, also is heavily involved in mental processes dealing with the 'subjective mind' or interior power. On the other hand, we have the 'conscious mind' which is also referred to as the 'objective mind' which deals with outward objects and impressions of life on the outside with the help of the 5 physical senses of sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing. Free throw shooting only requires 2 of these namely sight and touch.
I have to share a personal experience where my subconscious actually manifested to me a life changing career. It was 1972, (you remember, where terrorism raised it's ugly head by using international athletics as a platform to make political statements, and where the USA men's Basketball team lost to the Russians on a controversial call) while I was representing Australia for the Olympic games for the first time, we got to travel with the team prior to the games around Europe and play some of the European teams as warm up exercises.
On this one particular warm summer day in the late August, we were in Italy passing through and we had a chance to see the ""Sistine Chapel"" which was painted by Michaelangelo in the 1500's. This excited me because I actually had read his Biography while in High School and his work fascinated me. Now that I had the chance to actually stand where he stood, well, I really jumped on the chance. I felt like Moses in the movie ""The Ten Commandments"" when he went up to Mount Sinai and approached the 'burning bush' and God spoke to him in his slow, deep and penetrating voice saying "" Moses, put off thine sandals from off thine feet, for thou standest on Holy ground"".
As I approached the chapel, I still recall that I had some funny feelings that I could not explain. A mixture of anxiety, curiosity and feelings of respect. As I entered and laid my eyes on this phenomenon I was blown away. After gazing upwards for a few hours I remember still to this day saying these words, ""There's no way in the world that this work was done by any human being. This work was guided by the hand of God."" Little did I realize that it would take about 15 years before the impact of inspiration would take hold. Remember that the subconscious is a marketplace for gathering and storing inspiration. And of course it wasn't for many years later that I realized how powerful the subconscious was and what we subject our minds to. ""As a man thinketh, so is he"". Well I never realized that Michaelangelo's work embossed a deep image into my mind and I guess if something leaves such a strong message on your mind then you will act upon it. Somehow, sooner or later it has to come out.
I had no idea that I had artistic tendencies since after I took an art class in High School, I really didn't connect with it. I did enjoy technical drawing which was more about lines, symmetry, depth and 3 dimensional work geared more towards architectural vocations. To make a long story short, I did my Master's degree in 1981 at Brigham Young University and chose as my Thesis and Dissertation to do an artistic project based on the greatness of man reaching his potential. I wanted to do something that would last a thousand years. So I chose to do a rendition of several athletes in action extending to their max in striving to reach their greatest potential and I decided to do it in tile, concrete and steel. I chose to do a 3-dimensional mosaic, which would weigh a half ton upon completion, would take over 400 hours to complete and it was done upside down and backwards, in my living room. Why a mosaic? Well I was so inspired by all the old masters I saw in my European travels I felt like I wanted to leave my mark using their medium.
The point I am trying to make here is that my subconscious changed my conscious processes into actually changing careers from a high school basketball coach to a full time traveling Sports artist where I painted Basketball court floors and wall murals with school mascots. This is powerful stuff and I have a testimony that won't stop. You could say that I actually do exactly what Michaelangelo did over 500 years ago. Except he traveled by donkey and I fly in jets to get to where I need to go.(If the price of fuel does not go down then I may be riding a donkey to work). Also he mostly laid on his back and I spend most of my time on my knees painting floors. Also, He was one of the greatest artists of all time and I am just a commercial artist trying to make a difference by improving the aesthetics within institutions. You could say that I did succeed in this at least because according to the floor companies they say I was single handedly responsible for changing the face of graphics on sports surfaces in the United States and even the Globe. So you see one person can make a difference. It wasn't my initial goal to do this. It just happened.
When we talk of 'consciousness' or the 'conscious', it may be a good idea to at least define the terms. According to Funk and Wagnall's Standard College Dictionary, the word ""conscious"" means awareness of one's own existence, feelings and thoughts, or of external objects and conditions; mentally awake.
On the other hand the term ""consciousness"" is the knowledge of sensations and mental operations, or of what passes in one's mind.
It is the conscious mind that is responsible for the most valuable thing we have in life and that is the ability to ""choose"". The conscious mind has the power of deductive, inductive and analytical reasoning. It is responsible for the ""will"" and all its capacities. Are you starting to see how your average free throw shooting process is going to take on a whole new life? We are talking about mind over matter, process over product and the beginning before the end. I would venture to say that most and I mean over 90%, no let me be more specific, over 99% of basketball players think of making the basket, or not missing. I have been asking players all over the world of every age and both genders for many years, what they think about at the time of release of the ball and you guessed it, all responses are the same. They think of the end result as opposed to the beginning mechanics which are the most important thing. More on this later.
Common sense tells us that the when a child is born the human mind is born with a blank slate or more specifically a blank tablet more commonly known as ""tabula rasa"".
As time passes this ""tabula rasa"" starts to absorb and store a lot of information, just like a computer. There are actually 3 conscious stages that once we understand them it may enlighten us about our own behavior. How can we get better if we don't know our problems? This can apply to many areas of life and not just shooting, which is really all we care about here.
First, there is the Pre-Conscious stage where voices and visions basically dictate and tell you what to do. You automatically obey the ""voices of authority"". In this stage 'obedience' is paramount.
Secondly, there is the Proto-Conscious stage where automatic thoughts and feelings dictate your behavior or tell you what to do. Those in this stage are true believers, fanatic fighters for a great cause, perhaps a suicide bomber, or a kame-kaze pilot. It could be a helpless 'wimp' always complaining and languishing in apathy. Or it could be a self-righteous preacher who makes himself look ""right"" and others look ""wrong"". In this stage being ""right"" is paramount.
Thirdly, there is just the ""Conscious"" stage where you are basically a master of your own emotions and feelings. You now have the ability to examine critically every concept, thought and action. You strive to increase your own competence in every aspect of your life that is important to you. You carefully observe the results you produce, using that as feed back to improve your concepts thoughts, actions and communications. In this stage producing results is paramount. This is where we need to be as coaches and players who have one thing in mind and that is to improve our percentages. Period. Become masters of our domain.
There are millions of people who constantly question and critically examine concepts, behaviors, beliefs, which are held sacred by their elders and contemporaries. These people want to produce improved results in their lives, in their careers, their relationships and their health and spiritual growth as well. It applies to any area where they think their results are below expectations, they seek to improve their knowledge, competence and skills. They also realize that some of their difficulties stem from their own destructive thoughts and behavior patterns acquired or developed during their own childhood. Their emphasis is on producing results and they are in control of the conscious stage.
By conscious, I mean critically aware, especially critically self-aware. Once I get into the finger placement and finger pressure accountability on the free-throw shot release you will better understand what I mean by critically self-aware. The proto-conscious person functions ""on automatic"" most of the time, like driving a car without thinking, or regurgitating automatic thoughts, or reacting emotionally like a puppet without critical awareness of the results being produced.
The critically conscious are definitely conscious of their consciousness. They critically monitor what they think, say, and do in order to produce the desired results. They develop the thinking skill of self-observation. The one critical aspect that I encourage we all inject into our own personal make-up if we want to improve our free throw shooting skills.
The conscious can and does actually instruct or direct the subconscious mind. It can be considered as a Big Brother or a bodyguard to the subconscious. But they definitely work hand in hand (excuse the pun). It is the conscious that dictates, controls and even overrules the subconscious thoughts if permitted.
Understanding the above paragraph will emphasize why during every free throw shot or any shot for that matter must have a conscious thought behind the action. You should never shoot a shot without a conscious thought involved because the human body as perfect as it is was not imbedded with a perfect shooting mechanism. We have the potential to create a perfect shooting mechanism but it must be consciously initiated only after a complete knowledge of perfect shooting principles is obtained and understood.
More specifically, your duty is to absolutely find out the reasons you do not make 95% from the free throw line. Children under 13-14 are excused from this high expectation. Usually it will be a physical and mechanical application which can be corrected and this is where the conscious, and subconscious start kicking in for your benefit and elevated shooting percentages.

Natasha Helfer Parker,9/9/2016 14:55,"
September 9,   bing.com – public domain. 
Today’s guest post is written by Dr. Jim Pfaus. Opinions shared on guest posts may not completely reflect the positions of the blog’s author. 
Dr. Jim Pfaus is a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Concordia University. “My research is generally concerned with the neurochemical and molecular events that subserve sexual behavior and neuroendocrine functions. I am interested in the role of brain monoamine and neuropeptide systems in sexual arousal, desire, reward, and inhibition in laboratory animals. I am also interested in the inhibitory and disinhibitory effects of drugs of abuse on sexual behavior.” 
The recent New Atlantis report purports to be “scientific” yet it twists Simon LeVay’s words toward their own VERY selective propaganda. 
In reality, there are PLENTY of data showing that in men sexual orientation is pretty well fixed by the time adolescence rolls around, and is likely so because of genetic factors that come into play in utero. 
For some women, however, the concept of fluidity between orientations suggests that it might not be fixed — for THEM (or that they are bisexual but can ascribe an orientation to what they do and how they feel about doing it, which I am sure can and is used by those saying it is all a “choice” as evidence of such choice). But, as with everything, women are the last to be understood in terms of their gender, sexual orientation, and manifestations of sexual pleasure. 
It is entirely possible that androgens “fix” everything into place in men in a way that seems immutable (along with our lost ability for female-like multiple orgasms). 
One of the biggest flaws in all of this is that sex serves at least two masters, reward and reproduction. The reward part is ultimately what matters most, since there is absolutely no reason that gay men and lesbians cannot make babies, which they now DO in far greater numbers than in the past. Western religions do not regard male homosexuality well (thanks Leviticus!), but one wonders if the reproductive element in this played a role in that. A man lyething with another man shall be stoned… but why? Because they “cannot” or “will not” make a baby for their doting mother who needs to be a grandmother to reach her cultural pinnacle? 
Maybe THAT is the choice that should be discussed, along with societal and cultural choices that might actually allow gay men to marry and create the kind of economic stability that a kid could be raised in. The one thing that a “choice” argument cannot get around is the FACT that gay men exist in EVERY culture, EVERY racial demographic, and EVERY epoch of recorded human history. Neither Communism or Capitalism can make that claim! 
The only way that homosexuality becomes something “hard to understand” is from a reproductive standpoint, especially in light of so-called “Evolutionary Psychological” theories that claim almost everything as genetic and biased toward “ultimate causality” meaning the propagation of the strong in a species. Like, what IF that is not the ONLY evolutionary pressure? What IF predisposition involves an early interaction with the external world as well, along with epigentic changes? That is not “choice” either… it is crystallization of behavioral patterns and conscious awareness of one’s own predisposition and orientation. And it has nothing whatsoever to do with “reproduction”— again, since gay men and lesbians CAN and DO reproduce. “Choice” is a loaded term. And VERY easy to pervert for anti-gay propaganda purposes… 

To be clear on the LDS church’s current official position on the matter of “choice” I quote from Love One Another: A Discussion on Same-Sex Attraction (an official LDS webpage): 
“The experience of same-sex attraction is a complex reality for many people. The attraction itself is not a sin, but acting on it is. Even though individuals do not choose to have such attractions, they do choose how to respond to them. With love and understanding, the Church reaches out to all God’s children, including our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters.” 
Although the Church takes a strong stance against homosexual behavior, it has at least moved away from seeing homosexuality as a “choice” or something that can be changed by entering a heterosexual marriage or undergoing reparative therapies (for the most part these are no longer the standard ecclesiastical recommendations that they were in the past). The LDS Church expects both romantic and sexual celibacy from its gay and lesbian members which is often not seen as a “loving and understanding” approach by those expected to live by such strict and unhealthy standards in order to remain “worthy” and be an active part of their church community. 
The following podcast interviewing a panel of professionals, that I was a part of along with Dr. Bill Bradshaw (retired BYU professor) and Dr. Daniel Parkinson (psychiatrist), is a resource some may be interested in:

ktmccleery,9/9/2016 14:58,"Our 48 hours in Utah were split between Salt Lake City, Ogden, and Provo, as we attempted to hit as many sites as possible before our long, 10-hour drive to Yosemite National Park on Thursday.
We began our day on Wednesday with a trip to Temple Square in Salt Lake City:
""Temple Square in Salt Lake City is Utah's most popular tourist destination. Part of its appeal lies in its accessibility: three city blocks in downtown Salt Lake City contain nearly 20 attractions related to Mormon pioneer history and genealogy, including the Salt Lake Temple, the Tabernacle, and the Family History Library. This means that visitors can see all or most of these attractions in a relatively short period of time.""
 
Salt Lake Temple
""This building is a worldwide icon of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the heart of Temple Square. The massive granite edifice was constructed in a neo-gothic style over the course of an astounding 40-year period between 1853 and 1893. The pioneers who settled the valley sacrificed both time and material goods to the building of the temple, which stands as a testament to their faith and devotion. Please be aware that only members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are permitted to enter the temple, but all visitors are welcome to peruse the grounds and admire the stunning workmanship of the building and the serene beauty of its immediate surroundings""
South Visitors' Center
""This building, just south of the temple, contains exhibits on the construction of the Salt Lake Temple and on the importance of family. Here you can also view pictures of the temple interior and a cross-sectional scale model of the Salt Lake Temple.""
North Visitors' Center
This building is home to an impressive 11-foot statue of Jesus Christ known as The Christus.""
Conference Center
""Located just north of the temple, the Conference Center of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints contains a 21,000-seat auditorium and an 850-seat theater. It also houses an array of artworks that tell about scripture stories, Church teachings and organization, and Jesus Christ. Free, guided tours of the Conference Center are available daily from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m, and tours of the beautiful rooftop gardens are available April through October.""
What a beautiful way to spend our morning in Salt Lake City!
From there we headed north to Ogden, Utah. Ogden is significant because of its family connections. It is where my mother grew up and my grandfather lived when we would travel west for family reunions. It was where my parents met. It was also where I attended school for a time at Weber State University.
It also happens to be home for my Great Aunt Ellen. I haven’t seen Aunt Ellen for a few years. She is 97 years old now and we wanted to make sure we fit in a visit with this special lady.
I decided to just take the girls with me for the visit. They are who Ellen has the most memories of and I thought Tyler and Ozzie might be a bit much for her, so Toby dropped us off at Ellen’s apartment, after we stopped and picked up a pretty plant for her, and then took the boys for a drive while we had a good visit.
When our visit with Aunt Ellen was over we took the kids on a tour around Ogden, showing them my old dorm and where I went to school.
We also drove up to where my mom grew up, to take a photo of her old house.
While I was standing outside her old home taking pictures, the owner came out. When I explained why I was there he graciously invited us in to see the backyard and inside of the house.  He and his family have done a lot of work on the place, but it was neat to still catch glimpses of the home I remember visiting my grandfather in when I was a child.
[gallery ids=""29355,29356,29357,29358"" type=""rectangular""]
We also drove past the condo my grandfather moved into when Grace was little. This is where she remembers visiting Great Grandpa when we flew out for his 90th birthday party.
I have a picture of 5-year-old Grace in this same spot.
Our visit was bittersweet. When you go back to a place of your past there are always mixed emotions. It was such a joy seeing Aunt Ellen and visiting places that hold such fond memories, but also a touch of sadness over loved ones who are gone and times that have been lost to the past.
While in Ogden we had one more stop to make before we began our drive down to Provo, Utah.
As a child I remember every time we came to Ogden we would stop and get a Lime Rickey. This drink was a childhood memory of my mother's years in Ogden and became a childhood memory for us kids that we associated with visits to Grandpa Parmley's house.
We couldn’t leave without letting the kids experience this yummy drink: a Lime Rickey!
Made from grape syrup, sprite and fresh limes, poured over crushed ice, it is the ultimate summer treat.
And it just so happened that they were having a special:  a large Lime Rickey for .99 cents. We stopped and bought one for each of us to enjoy on our two-hour drive to Provo.
On Thursday morning Toby dropped Grace, Molly, Rusty and I off at the BYU campus for a college tour. While we were touring Toby was able to drive around his old stompin' ground with the little boys and show them  where he served a mission when he was 19 years old.
When we arrived we were assigned a student tour guide who took us by golf cart around campus.
The kids all received a BYU t-shirt and a folder of information about the school.
While we toured the campus we kept our eyes open for many of our Pittsburgh North friends who are attending school there, but didn’t spot anyone we knew. It wasn’t surprising since there are 30,000 students on campus.
This was our second college tour on this road trip, but the 5th college tour for Grace. It was a beautiful campus but didn’t have the same feel that we loved about BYU Idaho. It was good to tour it, and get a feel for the campus and the school, and they had so much to offer...
but it doesn’t feel right for Grace.
We will see what she decides. Application dates are looming and she will need to start praying about where the Lord wants her to go, but it seemed to me that BYU isn’t at the top of her list.
We will see.
After a good visit to northern Utah it was back on the road again. We will be returning to Utah in a couple weeks to tour the National Parks of southern Utah,
But for now…
California, here we come!
Next Stop: Yosemite National Park

Jake Welch,9/9/2016 15:02,"
By Jake Welch  @BYUAllBlue on Sep 9, 2016, 8:02a + It’s time to end Utah’s run of five straight victories over BYU. In order to do so, I’m going to embrace my love for the University of Utah and their gracious fan base.  Share Share on Facebook + Comments It’s rivalry week. It still feels terribly strange saying that because we’re only in the second week of the season and we’re still enjoying the warm embrace of having football back in our lives. Now, just a few short days into this promising season, we have to play our longstanding rival and deal with all of the hullabaloo that goes along with it. The most difficult realization for us BYU fans is that we haven’t beaten Utah since 2009 when Max Hall connected with Andrew George for a thrilling overtime victory. I remember it well because while running down the stadium stairs to rush the field I missed a step and landed flat on my backside. (P.S. is it bad that my tailbone still hurts to this day?) My hind parts aside, it’s time that we full recognize the reason why BYU has lost all of these football games against Utah the last six years. The curse of Max Hall is real. If you need a refresher, after BYU’s victory over Utah in 2009 Max Hall had a few choice words for the University of Utah and their entire fan base. ""I think the whole university and their fans and the organization is classless. They threw beer on my family and stuff last year and did a whole bunch of nasty things. I don't respect them and they deserved to lose."" In the moment, it was just another piece of fuel to the Holy War fire, but what we can see now is that his post-game firestorm resulted in a full-blown, Steve Bartman-style curse. Ever since that day, BYU has found just about every way possible to lose to Utah. There have been blowouts, blocked kicks, and most recently, a baffling bowl game in Vegas. Having recognized the hex that one Max Hall has placed upon us, I have decided to do my due diligence and find a way to reverse the curse. This thing needs to end and I think I know exactly what needs to happen. You see, the Curse of Max Hall exists because of his strong declaration of hate for the University of Utah, the players and their fans. It was hate that brought us here and I think it’s love that is going to bring us back to normalcy. That’s right, I’m going to do the unthinkable. I’m here to declare my love for the University of Utah. I know what you’re thinking. There is no way on that you, a BYU fan, can say that you love Utah! That’s no t how love works! Well, let me tell you, there is a lot of love for the Utes in this heart and I’m not afraid to let it out. First off, I love the attentive nature and devotion of Utah fans. They are some of the most observant and conscientious people I know. Of course I’m not referring to the passion they have for their own school, rather the endless hours they spend dedicating their lives to following BYU athletics. After every BYU game, my close friends who are Ute fans are able to speak at length about how poorly my team is playing based on the entire game they watched the previous week. I understand that they’re probably not watching BYU football because they enjoy it, but I sure do appreciate that they take the time to tune in and watch our boys in blue. I honestly wish I could do the same but I can’t seem to find the Pac-12 Network. The watchful eye that Utah fans keep over all things BYU isn’t limited to live broadcasts. In the last few weeks, I’ve had the pleasure of being followed by multiple Utah fans on Twitter. Now they get mobile alerts any time I tweet something like “1984” or “Honor Code” so they can jump right into the conversation. It’s great knowing that they are here to support me every step of the way. Speaking of support and the honor code, I can’t say enough about how quickly Utah fans alert us of potential Honor Code violations by specific BYU players, students and fans that have graduated from the school well over a decade ago. A lot of BYU fans did attend the school and lived under the Honor Code, but no one has studied the ins and outs of it quite like the Utah fans. Not only do they inform us of the wrongdoings, they will go the extra mile to contact the Honor Code office to report a potential violation. What more could you ask for? I mean, “the world is our campus” and Utah fans live in that world, so it’s so kind of them to offer up their investigative services. Did I mention how supportive Utah fans have been through the whole Big 12 expansion process? If it weren’t for Utah fans, I would be much less informed on the things that are allegedly happening at those Big 12 expansion meetings. Usually Utah fans only tell us the reasons why BYU won’t be invited to the Big 12, but it’s nice that they’re so invested in the process. Having one fan base with super secret insider sources was great, but adding another one to the mix has been extremely motivational. Something that I also love about the University of Utah and their fans is how respectful they are to the BYU name. Ever since Urban Meyer (bless his heart) was the head coach at Utah, players and fans have decided to refer to BYU as “the team down south” or “TDS,” which I absolutely love. I understand that when talking about the rivalry things can get pretty heated. Instead of using an ugly or inappropriate tone to reference our beloved university, they reverence the name of Brigham Young and have decided to use an alternative way to acknowledge our school. So when I hear someone say “The TDS is garbage,” I know that they don’t really want to associate BYU with the word garbage, so out of respect they use a different acronym. I’m sure there are a few Utah fans that say calling our school by a derogatory shorthand (such as TDS) makes others think less of BYU. Well, isn’t that just cute! I mean, to think that a fan would refuse to say a name of someone or something they don’t like is like a spurned ex-boyfriend or girlfriend who demands that all of their friends never mention the name, hair color or favorite food of their former lover. I understand that a brief mention of the color blue or the name Jimmer stirs up some pretty powerful emotions. It really moves you and I think that’s just precious. Lastly, I love how generous Utah fans are with their alcoholic beverages. Every time I go to Rice-Eccles Stadium, the fans are pretty much lining up to let me have a taste. Now, usually they get so excited that they end up spilling their beer all over my pants, but I know their heart is in the right place. They just want to give of their substance. On second thought, those big-hearted Utes probably realized that drinking alcohol is against the Honor Code, so they do their best to accidentally spill it to ensure there is no chance that a BYU fan will take a sip and go to Honor Code jail. I could go on for days, but I don’t want to get too gushy. I tend to do that when talking about my favorite people. At any rate, I hope this confession of love will break the Max Hall Curse and we can go back to our winning ways. In the event that my love confession wasn’t enough, feel free to share a few reasons why you love Utah in the comments section. More from Vanquish The Foe

I started BYU as a freshman, but after failing twice to get into the program, the U accepted me graciously. I also got my first full-time job at the U after I graduated. I learned so much there, and am so grateful for that time. After having attended and been employed by both universities, and having attended games at both schools, I can easily say that we're more alike than we are different. I love the rivalry, and am happy to have these two stellar schools in such close proximity. May both teams play their best, and have minimal injuries.

aclarkmeyers,9/9/2016 15:36,"Some years ago, my dear friend’s grandmother sat next me at his wedding. Conversation ensued and I was surprised to hear her launch into a discussion of Thomsonian medicine upon hearing that I was an herbal healer. She told me she had learned it from her mother growing up. I had had always had the understanding that Mormons relied primarily on faith healing and such interventions of that nature were not widely performed by women.
Intrigued, I began to gather research on the topic which was surprisingly easy to do given the thorough records kept by the early Mormon settlers. The first interesting thing I found is that in the early days, Mormon leaders encouraged women to work as healers. Even before the Mormons made it as far as Utah, the women of Nauvoo had established the Nauvoo Female Relief Society. The group formed in 1847 was known to hold healing circles to support one another and other women in their community during times of illness. Joseph Smith, founder of the Mormon religion, defended their right to practice these rituals saying both males and females should follow their calling as healers (Stapley & Wright, 2011).
The historical bias against botanic medicine and the Mormons in general led to them being written about in an unflattering manner in academia. For example, historians who studied the Mormon culture have always been quick to criticize the Mormon opposition to orthodox medical doctors. While it is true that Brigham Young publicly ridiculed the “poison doctors” of orthodox medicine, (Terry, 1964) this was at a time when much of America was lashing back against the practices of bleeding and harsh chemicals used by these doctors. He was hardly unique.
The truth is medical intervention was in no way frowned upon by the early leaders of the church. Midwives and Thomsonian doctors were encouraged to attend to the ill and the practice of botanic medicine was fully sanctioned (Terry, 1964). Joseph Smith wrote ""He who is sick without faith to be healed, treat with herbs and give mild food, and this not by the hand of an enemy” (Simmerman 1993).
Ritual Aspects of Healing
Healing rituals were one tool used by Mormon healers, but that is hardly unique to that culture. Diaries from the time detail these methods:
They had washed Sister Young preparatory to having her annointed which ordanance {sic} I attended to after we had prayers, Sister Lawson being mouth made an excellent and humble prayer. Then I called Sopha to seal the annointing, which she did in a praiseworthy manner, for one so young” (Stapley & Wright, 2011).
There is some confusion as to what these terms meant. An interesting remedy from the journal of Dr. Priddy Meeks sheds some light on the term “anointing” and seems to indicate that when someone was ill there was more to the practice than simply using consecrated oil anointments. Here he details such a preparation.
To cure swelled joints: Take two hen eggs beat fine. Put in one tablespoon each of table salt and black pepper in one pint of good vinegar. Mix it well together. Anoint with it, rubbing it downward with the hand several times a day (Meeks, 1879).
Lay Midwifery
Women were “set apart” by the leaders of the Mormon church to the calling of being a midwife as it was inappropriate for a man to attend childbirth—even a physician (Terry, 1964). That herbs were the preferred method of treatment in the very early days of the church is evidenced by the fact that Joseph Smith assured Mrs. Ann Carling that she would “be blessed as a midwife if she used herbs exclusively in her work” (Noall, 1944).
Midwives were often trained by Thomsonian doctors and became quite skilled in botanic medicine. Dr. Priddy Meeks trained many midwives, including his wife Mary Jane McCleve Meeks. He passed along typical botanic medicine remedies such as the synergistic formula of cayenne and Lobelia inflata.
Meeks thought a good deal of lobelia. In his journal he assures the reader “after taking a dose it instantly permeates the whole system, removing obstructions wherever found, and restoring a healthy action wherever needed, and is one of the most powerful relaxants known in the science of medicine, and yet perfectly harmless in all its operations upon the human system, being in perfect harmony with the laws of life and health” (Meeks, 1897).
Some midwives were immigrants who had trained in their home countries. Janet Downy Hardie learned studied under a prominent doctor in Scotland who was a pioneer in the field of anesthetics and established a successful practice in Salt Lake City. She was quick to note the usefulness of the jimson weed (Datura stramonium) that scattered the Southern Utah landscape as an anodyne.
Other midwives such as Patty Sessions had picked up herbal healing in the East before moving West with the Mormon pioneers (Gifford, 2003) and used many of the common over-the-counter products of the day. Sessions credited her midwifery training to a Native American midwife by the name of Molly Ockett who “knew about herb lore and how to concoct salves, drinks and poultices administered to the sick” (Smart, 1997).
That she attended to more than just childbirth is evidenced by this excerpt from her journal.
for jaundice take one tablespoonful of casteel soap shavings mixed with shugar [sic] three mornings then miss three until it is taken nine mornings shure cure[sic]
for bowel complaint take tea one spoonful of rub arb one forth carbnet soda one table spoonful brandy one tea spoonful peperment [sic] essence half tea cup ful warm water take a table spoonful once an hour untill [sic] it opporates. [sic]

2h tea cups water take a tablespoon ful at a time till it stops it if the first
dose dont repeat it.
Cure for gravel wild rose berrys boiled long drink the tea (Smart, 1997).
Domestic Medicine
The biggest injustice that historians of the 20th century did was to overlook the practice of domestic medicine in Mormon households. The typical Mormon housewife had plenty of tricks up her sleeve when it came to dealing with common illnesses. Many of the remedies are those you see commonly used in New England had undoubtedly been passed down from mother -to-daughter.
Clarissa Young Spencer recalls that in the days of growing up in Brigham Young’s household they were exposed to all of the common medicines of the day including camphor, mustard, hot drops and composition powder (Spencer & Harmer, 1940).
Some of the preparations used in Brigham Young’s household were undoubtedly learned from domestic medicine manuals such as Samuel Thomson’s Botanic Family Physician or Colby’s Guide to Health. Composition powder was one of Young’s favorite remedies and was included in many self-care manuals of the day. His daughter said that he drank the beverage like others would drink coffee or tea (Spencer & Harmer, 1940) and she shared the following recipe which varies from Thomson’s only in the addition of cinnamon.
Brigham Young’s Favorite Composition Powder
Adapted from Brigham Young at Home by Clarissa Young Spencer
Ingredients
4 ounces bayberry powder
4 ounces poplar bark powder
4 ounces hemlock* inner bark powder
2 ounces ground ginger
2 ounces ground cloves
2 ounces ground cinnamon
1 ounces cayenne pepper
Directions
Mix the powders well.
Store in an airtight container
Mix a small bit on the end of a spoon (approx. 1 teaspoon) into a cup of hot water
Traditionally served with cream and sugar
*It is important to note that this in this recipe “hemlock” most likely refers to Pinus canadensis-the hemlock spruce. The bark was widely used in Thomsonian medicine. There is an outside and less likely chance it refers to Taxus canadensis, also known as Canada yew or ground hemlock. The aerial part of this shrub (twigs and bark) was widely used as a medicinal by indigenous North Americans. Regardless the term “hemlock” should NOT be confused with Conium maculatum.
The hot drops that Spencer mentions were a common Thomsonian preparation and were used externally to address rheumatic conditions and toothache pain. Internally it was used for diarrhea and “bathing in case of debility of relaxed state of the surface” (Colby, 1844). The fourth proof brandy mentioned in the recipe is a type of brandy that was 58% alcohol rather than the standard 50% alcohol brandy preparations (Hiss & Ebert, 1909).
Colby’s Hot Drops
From Colby’s Guide to Health
Ingredients
12 ounces gum myrrh
1 ounce cayenne
1 gallon fourth proof brandy
Directions
Place the ingredients in a glass container with a tight lid
Shake daily for one week.
Strain and bottle.
Dosage is one to four teaspoons full in hot water.
Mothers’ Remedies for Illnesses
As has been the case throughout history all over the world, mothers were Mormon families’ first line of defense against illness. Mothers hung bags full of the crushed resin asafoetida around the necks of their children to ward off illness during the winter months. They used onion poultices for chest colds and made onion cough syrup. Another cough remedy was to make an ointment of cayenne, vinegar, and butter (Hatfield, 2014).
Rashes were “brought out” by means of a tea made of catnip, saffron, sassafras, and peppermint (Fife, 1957). Mrs. Willard Richards recalled her mother’s fever remedy saying,
My mother used to take burdock leaves and put them around her feet to reduce the fever. She would peel back the outer layer over some of the veins…she would take the green leaves, and after peeling them back, would wrap them around her feet, and tie them with a string, up toward the ankle, like a little moccasin (Noall, 1944).
She also talked of seeing her mother steam a sibling suffering from typhoid with catnip and peppermint tea (Noall, 1944).
In 1942, Mrs. Ellen Hoyt shared the following remedy she learned from her mother, “Bladder trouble is cured with burdock and dandelion leaves. You change off with gravel weed” (Noall, 1944).
Remedies for Injuries and Pain
White liniment was a popular topical preparation for aches and pains. Directions for making it were simply, “One egg, fill the shell once with vinegar and once with turpentine” (Huff, 1947). A popular remedy for chilblains was to mix equal parts of mutton tallow, olive oil, camphor, and brandy (Terry, 1964). For old wounds that weren’t healing, Patty Sessions made an ointment of indigo-weed root which she boiled down and then mixed with beeswax, mutton tallow, and a very little rosin” (Noall, 1944). Sunburns were treated with cream.
Native Plants Enter the Materia Medica
Mormon healers also had interesting uses for plants native to their new home in Utah. They used Ephedra viridis to make a stimulating daily beverage known as Brigham Tea (Terry, 1964). They also made an ointment for burns and wounds by boiling piñon pitch, straining it, and mixing it with mutton tallow and carbolic acid (Fife, 1957). Quaking aspen was used in bitters blends while sumach was a popular astringent. (Meeks, 1897)
Sagebrush was another plant widely used. Heavenly beings supposedly appeared and recommended that infusions of the plant be used as a medicinal (Fife, 1957). It was used for making a stimulating tea, a hair rinse to grow hair, and a soak for sprains and bruises (Hatfield, 2004). Mrs. Sara Barry of Lehi, Utah, learned the use of herbs from her mother who was a midwife. In a 1943 interview, she recalled accounts of the infusion being used to heal a young man’s injured leg and using it to help her own husband to recover from frostbite “Sagebrush takes the lead” she assured the interviewer (Fife, 1957).
Mr. Otho Murphy told this story about the use of cattails as a medicinal:
Grandma Brack was the first doctor in the country and I think they considered her a little bit on the witch side, but she did great good. I can remember one instance in which my mother got blood poisoning in her arm and her arm and hand swelled up and were as black as could be. We went for Grandma Brack and she told us to get on a horse and go down to the river and dig down three feet in the swamp and to get the roots of cattails and to bring them up here and crush them and put new milk on it and to make a poultice and to put in on mother’s arm. In sight of four hours there wasn’t a thing wrong (Fife, 1957).
Lessons from Native American Neighbors
Some of these herbal remedies were picked up through interactions with neighboring Native American groups. Mrs. Berry also recalled that her mother used sunflower seeds as both medicine and food saying, “Their special mission is for the kidneys, but they're good for food, too. Once, when Mother went to an Indian village to get a baby that the squaws couldn't bring, she saw the Indians grinding sunflower seeds in a hollow rock with another rock for food” (Noall, 1944).
Mormons adopted the use of Kinnikinnick, as a blood builder, from Native American cultures. (Terry, 1969). A report on Chippewa Customs to the Bureau of American Ethnology in 1910 explains that the mixture was originally the dried leaves of bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) and the dried powdered root of the New England aster (Aster novae-angliae) (Densmore, 1910). There is no way of being certain which plants were included in the Mormon preparation as the ingredients varied from region-to-region.
Carrot seed powder was used as a diuretic and pumpkin seeds were given to those with tapeworms (Terry, 1969). As these are both New World plants, it stands to reason that these uses were also picked up from indigenous peoples.
As you can see, the detailed histories compiled by Mormon scholars give us a wealth of information about their practices. This provides us with a unique look at frontier medicine that we would otherwise know very little about.

OK, so I’ll level with you: you know how last week’s slate of college football games was unreal and there was no way that Week 2 was ever going to compare to Week 1? Well, uh, it appears that the schedule makers agree with this assessment.
Don’t get me wrong, there are some really fun games in this week’s slate, but it’s not the kind of weekend where you turn on football at noon and don’t get off of your couch until 2 a.m. Rather, this week’s kind of mellow – the kind of weekend where you can watch a game and then not feel guilty about leaving for a little to grab lunch or do the laundry or something.
But still! There is college football this weekend. It’s fun. Let’s look at the matchups you need to check out, from the start of the day all the way up until you want to go to bed:
Early Slate
[caption id=""1785138"" align=""aligncenter"" caption="""" credit=""Getty Image"" credit_src=""""][/caption]
FRONT AND CENTER
Noon: Penn State at Pittsburgh (ESPN)
Full disclosure: I am a Penn State alumnus. I do not like the University of Pittsburgh’s football program. I am also essentially out of fingernails at this point because I have bitten them all off.
This is a big game for both programs, as both are trying to claim supremacy in Pennsylvania. For Penn State, knocking off Pitt means that it will beat its biggest in-state rival, both in terms of on-field success and off-field things like recruiting. For Pitt, this means that it gets to call itself the undisputed best team in the commonwealth for the first time in eons. Both programs are trending upward, and this game could end up being fun to watch. It could also be a horrible, disgusting slopfest the likes of which we haven’t seen since the last time these two squads played and Pitt won 12-0 in 2000. Who knows.
All I know is James Conner is the man, and this may be pessimism setting in, but this seems like the kind of game where he announces he’s back in a big way and goes for like 120 yards and two touchdowns. I am very nervous and will watch this entire game curled up in a ball.
SECOND SCREEN SPECIAL
Either Noon or 12:30 p.m.: Troy at Clemson or Charleston Southern at Florida State or UCF at Michigan or Lamar at Houston or Nicholls State at Georgia (ACC Network Extra or ACC Network Extra or ABC or ESPN3 or SEC Network)
I won’t lie and say that you should expect an upset in any of these games. However, if you want to watch a good ol’ fashioned whoopin’, odds are that you’ll get a few in this group. And who knows? Maybe one of these underdog squads – the respective lines are Clemson -36.5, N/A, Michigan -36, N/A, and N/A, per Bovada – can make things interesting.
Dog Day Afternoon
[caption id=""1785137"" align=""aligncenter"" caption="""" credit=""Getty Image"" credit_src=""""][/caption]
FRONT AND CENTER
2 p.m.: Utah State at USC (Pac-12 Network)
3:30 p.m.: Kentucky at Florida (CBS)
Don’t let last weekend fool you: USC is a good football team, Alabama is just horrifying, and Lane Kiffin was gunning for 500 points. Unfortunately, USC gets to follow up its ‘Bama beatdown by playing a game that kicks off at 11:30 their time against a Utah State team that, while not great, is going to punch them in the mouth repeatedly. Keep an eye on JuJu Smith-Schuster, who caught one ball against the Crimson Tide and will try his hardest to carve up a solid Aggies secondary. Also, Chuckie Keeton is no longer at Utah State, which is sad, but Kent Myers is a pretty good quarterback who has the potential to make this game intriguing.
Quick question: what is the longest active winning streak for one opponent over another in college football?
(say Florida over Kentucky)
That’s right! It’s Florida over Kentucky! The Gators and the Wildcats have played every year since 1987, and Florida has not lost once in that time. That's 29 consecutive wins over Kentucky, and while plenty of people thought this might be the year, the Wildcats went out and lost 44-35 to Southern Miss last week. Still, watch this one because even though Florida is (probably) a better team and the game’s in Gainesville. It’s always fun to watch something historic happen. (Unless, of course, your team is the one that loses. That’s not that fun.)
SECOND SCREEN SPECIAL
3:30 p.m.: Western Kentucky at Alabama (ESPN2)
4 p.m.: Ball State at Indiana (ESPNEWS)
Western Kentucky is known for being really, really fun under Jeff Brohm. The Hilltoppers went 12-2 last season and scored fewer than 30 points twice: once against Vandy, once against LSU, both on the road. Of course, it’s a new year, and Alabama is college football’s version of a black hole. The Crimson Tide are in all likelihood going to maul the Hilltoppers, but this game has a little chaos potential (admittedly not much, but a little).
Hey, speaking of chaos, let’s talk about my favorite college football program: the Indiana Hoosiers! Indiana is so perfect because they’re the team that epitomizes everything that makes college football is so great – absolutely anything can happen when the Hoosiers take the field. This is especially true when they play Ball State, as Hoosiers coach Kevin Wilson has never beaten the Cardinals (in fairness, both games came during his first two years when IU went a combined 5-19). Indiana should win this one, but if you’re looking for *actual* potential chaos, look no further than this game.
Under the Lights
[caption id=""1785139"" align=""aligncenter"" caption="""" credit=""USA TODAY Sports"" credit_src=""""][/caption]
FRONT AND CENTER
7 p.m.: Arkansas at TCU (ESPN)
8 p.m.: Virginia Tech vs. Tennessee (at Bristol Motor Speedway) (ABC)
In all honesty, Va. Tech at Tennessee may not be that great of a game – we saw last week that the Vols either have a way to go before they’re ready to compete for the SEC title, or they’re just not that great. And no one knows what to expect with the Hokies under new head coach *Mack Brown voice* Justin Fuente. But it’s being played at a dang NASCAR track, so visually, it’s going to be cool. Seriously, look at this!
https://twitter.com/BMSupdates/status/773159058790617089
That's insane! Anyway, Tennessee, for how it looked last week, is still really talented, while Virginia Tech wide receiver Isaiah Ford is a total beast. Heck, just watch Isaiah Ford every weekend. He's fantastic.
If you want a game that will definitely be fun, watch what’s going to happen when the Hogs travel to Fort Worth. Arkansas always manages to play in games that go completely insane, as does TCU. Last week, Arkansas beat Louisiana Tech, 21-20, and TCU beat South Dakota State, 59-41. This game is going to be silly. If Va. Tech vs. Tennessee turns into messy football, definitely throw this on. Even if it doesn't, this game has the potential to be the best one that you'll see this weekend.
SECOND SCREEN SPECIAL
7:30 p.m.: BYU at Utah (FOX)
7:30 p.m.: Iowa State at Iowa (Big Ten Network)
Two really great rivalry games will warrant your attention on Saturday. First, there’s BYU and Utah, who will face off for the 97th Holy War. This game is going to be really ugly, and both teams are going to attempt to grind out a gross win. It won’t be the most aesthetically pleasing game of the weekend, but emotions will be high and you’ll probably see at least one grown man cry no matter the outcome.
And then there’s the most important game of the weekend, ¡El Assico! For the uninitiated, this is the annual meeting between Iowa and Iowa State, and this year’s game is hosted by the Hawkeyes. Odds are Iowa is going to roll Iowa State, but respect the G.O.A.T. rivalry in North American sports and watch this for a little.
The Late Show
[caption id=""1785144"" align=""aligncenter"" caption="""" credit=""Getty Image"" credit_src=""""][/caption]
FRONT AND CENTER
10 p.m.: Texas Tech at Arizona State (FS1)
10:15 p.m.: Washington State at Boise State (ESPN2)
10:30 p.m.: California at San Diego State (CBS Sports Network)
SECOND SCREEN SPECIAL
10:30 p.m.: Virginia at Oregon (ESPN)
Any of these games can be front and center and any of them can be on a second screen. At least one of these games is going to be completely bonkers – my money is on Cal vs. SDSU, as Cal’s combination of high-octane offense and not great defense doesn’t match up very well against San Diego State’s stout defense and and stellar running game led by Donnel Pumphrey (this year's award winner for best college football player you’ve never heard of). Seriously, if he runs for 1,500 yards this year, he'll end his career with the sixth-most yards (5,870) in the history of the sport. Considering how he ran for 1,867 yards as a sophomore and 1,653 as a junior, that seems entirely possible. Donnel Pumphrey rules, and you should love him is what I'm trying to say. Let's move on.
Washington State is going to try to throw for all the yards on a really good Boise State team (shocker: Boise State is really good), Texas Tech and Arizona State has “first to 50 wins ... maybe” written all over it, and considering that Virginia got mollywhopped by Richmond last week and this game kicks off at 10:30 p.m. EST, Oregon may beat the spirit of the Lord out of them.
Considering how this isn’t the best weekend of the year, you should definitely stay up late and watch some of these. And who knows? Maybe one of these games will be better than anything we saw during the first week of the season.

BYU-Idaho plans to finish construction in time for Fall Semester 2016. The Science and Technology Building will provide classrooms for students and offices for faculty in the Departments of Animal and Food Science, Applied Plant Science, Computer Information Technology, and Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, according to byui.edu. Construction began in March 2015.

Britt Hanson,9/9/2016 15:53,"Happy Friday, friends! Do you ever feel like short weeks seem like the longest? That's how this week has seemed to me! We ran a lot of errands, and went a lot of places, but at least we were productive! I'm looking forward to an evening in the mountains though, and roasting marshmallows around a fire. So if you need me tonight, that's where I'll be. (PS, all the praise hands for the cooler weather we've been having! I love it!) Today's Blog-tember prompt is a good 'un, so let's jump in!
Today's Prompt: If You Could Go Anywhere In The World, Where Would You Go?
All my life (or at least since I was about 8), I have dreamed of going to Paris. My mom is British, and my dad served a mission in France, and so Europe in general has always been a big part of my life. I visited England 4 times in my first 12 years of life (but would love to go back now, as an adult!) and was fascinated with the cobblestone roads and the cold, damp air. I started taking French in 6th grade. My elementary school was across the road from Brigham Young University (where I later ended up going to college!) and we had French majors come and teach early morning French classes to those who were interested. From day one, I was hooked. I took French every year during junior high and high school.  I took French 4 my junior year, which was dual-enrollment at the university down the road, and then I took AP French my senior year. However, when starting college, I decided to start over with Beginning French, to get a good foundation, and because I wasn't sure how hard college language classes would be. I took French each semester of my freshman and sophomore years, and then I was faced with a hard decision --- do I continue taking French classes? Do I major or minor in it? Does it fit in with my mapped our course schedule for junior and senior year? Ultimately, I decided to end my French career, as it were. And sometimes I'm still sad about it.
I suppose that was a lot of background to say, I love the French language, and I love France, and I would love to visit Paris (but really all of France, as well). I have numerous pictures and posters of the Eiffel Tower, and other French scenes, I have a necklace with the Eiffel Tower on it, the day Paris was attacked I felt my heart break. In all, a piece of my heart has always belonged to Paris, and to France.
And one day, I will go there.
And it will be a glorious day, indeed.
Because really, is there a more beautiful structure in the world? No, the answer is no.
(And in other news, our Florida trip in March is officially BOOKED! I cannot wait to take my kiddos to Disneyworld, and I'm freaking out about returning to Hogwarts. Plus, seeing my dad isn't a bad thing either!)
I hope you enjoyed learning about where I would go! Any other Paris lovers out there? I'll be back on Monday sharing 3 books!

infosegue,9/9/2016 15:57,"the post is also available in: Hebrew :הכתבה זמינה גם ב
For unmanned aircraft systems to safely fly in increasingly crowded airspace, they must be able to accurately detect and avoid obstacles like trees, power lines, and critically, other aircraft. In efforts to safely introduce more unmanned aircraft into the skies, Virginia Tech researchers and scientists from Brigham Young University have equipped an unmanned aircraft with a newly designed radar system and optical video cameras to collect data that will help aerospace engineers develop avoidance technology.
Mark Blanks, the director of the Virginia Tech Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership explained: “This is one of the core challenges with unmanned aircraft systems: the ability to detect and avoid other aircraft,” said .
The Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership together with some researchers are aiming to create a database similar to ones used in computer vision research, where huge repositories of labeled images are used as test sets for visual-recognition software. In this case, the database will provide researchers with information on what potential obstacles, like a telephone pole or a small quadcopter, would look like to an aircraft’s sensors. Using two types of sensors could allow aircraft control software to assess potential hazards more accurately.
According to vtnews.vt.edu, the researchers are analyzing and processing the sensor data from the flights, and will store the data in a publicly available database, along with the GPS coordinates corresponding to each data point — showing an obstacle’s true location as well as its sensed location.
This data will aid the community’s understanding of the capabilities and challenges of detecting and avoiding small unmanned aircraft.
Blanks added: “This is an exciting project, because having a readily accessible database like this will be a key enabler for development of new technology to facilitate unmanned aircraft systems integration. It will be phenomenally impactful for the future of unmanned aircraft in the national airspace.”
Current research topics include flight beyond visual line of sight, flight operations over people, unmanned aircraft system airworthiness certification, air traffic management, remote sensing and payload development support, and airspace integration.

Kurt Cobain (alterna-rocker, self-inflicted shot-gun blast); Bobby Fuller (heir in order to Buddy Holly's rocker crown, accidental death via huffing gasoline).  Maureen McCormick had the actual dubious distinction of becoming the actual iconic Marcia Brady on the mega-hit sitcom, The Actual Brady Bunch (which had ended its run just a couple of years just before Diff'rent Strokes started).  As Dana would later on discover, when the actual brand name of your specific character can be stamped upon an actress, Hollywood doesn't want to know through her.  Maureen struggled to always be able to be taken critically plus brief order (like Anissa Jones) the lady has been in drugs along with living the reckless life.  Your Woman became a new coke hag - her consumption and require pertaining to cocaine was a quiet joke throughout Hollywood, and the lady or even he purportedly became a coke whore involving sorts, going into right directly into a long-term and also destructive relationship with a drug dealer just therefore your ex supply could remain steady.  The Girl reported when huddling throughout paranoid fear on the ground of a closet throughout a several-day cocaine binge.  Unlike Anissa Jones, however, Maureen McCormick finally managed to arrived at grips together with your ex reality as ""forever Marcia"" along with cleaned up your ex act.Dana Plato was obviously a quite however unhappy young woman whom enjoyed early celebrity simply to observe it slip from the girl grasp.  The Girl decline and demise are generally pitiful as well as sympathetic despite the circumstances.  The Woman's drug as well as alcohol use exacerbated the girl currently shaky self-confidence along with feeling of self-worth.  Dana Plato's depression and isolation killed your ex as surely as does the girl drug use.  Tragic?  Absolutely.  Avoidable?  probably not: with out assist from a genuinely caring party, the actual death of Dana Plato ended up being inevitable. Despairing involving at virtually any time being noticed again, the particular 25-year-old approached Playboy magazine to complete any nude pictorial spread.  Pictures were taken involving the girl in the Arizona desert in late 1988.  That They appeared throughout the June 1989 issue with the magazine.  Regarding the simply real interest this generated had been negative.  The Actual images are usually up to normal - Dana were built along with a lovely body - but the truth of the woman's bid regarding attention has been written all over your incident.  Furthermore, Dana Plato had adopted an extremely glum demeanor - using the exception of posed pictures where the girl was obviously wearing any forced The display biz industry smile, your woman often looked damage and sad.  Actually in certain associated with her Playboy photographs she looks despondent (in some associated with the photos the woman's deal with can't be seen; your woman will be both turned away from the camera as well as she's got a hat lowered over her face).Her interview using Stern about Might 7, 1999, had been emotionally overcharged for Dana, with callers to the demonstrate heckling her and also calling the girl names.  Stern seemed sympathetic for you to her, and also plugged an upcoming public look of hers, a new concert event she would emcee within Chicago within the subsequent a pair of weeks.  The Girl came away from the interview (having aired the woman's dirty laundry completely - drug use, criminal behavior, etc.) feeling perhaps a new bit drained.  The Lady returned to be able to Florida for you to your ex boyfriend and their RV. Regardless, Dana Plato stood a comparable organic appeal across the lines of the really well-known Brooke Shields.  she had largish eyebrows which she did not bother to become able to downplay.  she has been freckled along with darkish blond, with a Cupid's bow upper lip.  The Girl was a genuinely quite girl, plus a clean face.Diff'rent Strokes wound down inside 1986 - throughout its final season Dana reprised your ex Kimberly role in any amount of episodes, but she was actually not section of the Drummond family virtually any longer.  Once the show ended, so would Dana's acting career.***She appeared in the 1975 episode associated with The Actual six Billion Dollar Man (in which in turn the Bionic Woman had been introduced).  The Lady in addition starred in a made-for-TV movie Beyond the actual Bermuda Triangle which same year.  The couple a lot more appearances regarding episodic television rounded out the girl profession just before your woman made your ex big-screen film début from 13 in 1977's Return to Boggy Creek.

[Gary Coleman, earning about $25,000 per episode and more about Diff'rent Strokes, have been systematically bilked from his earnings as being a minor by his adoptive parents.  When the demonstrate ended, he had been broke.].  Anissa Jones' earnings from family Affair had been positioned inside have confidence in along with invested in US Government Financial Savings Bonds (a surprisingly prescient transfer about the section of the woman's management). For the actual unhappy as well as stunning Dana Plato the lethal combination of losing it all, typecasting woes, drug abuse, along with depression resulted in her suicide inside 1999.  This particular has been a morose youthful woman; your ex melancholy can be clear in almost every photo taken involving the woman's in the years right away just before her death.

clearadmitadmin,9/9/2016 16:00,"Thanks to a recent court decision in the case of Kopaigora v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, students enrolled in an MBA program—particularly an Executive MBA (EMBA)—can now deduct more education expenses from their taxes. While the case can’t be appealed or formerly cited as precedent, there’s no doubt that the outcome will be influential for the IRS and MBA students all over the United States.
It’s a big win considering the fact that in 2015, around 12,000 students were enrolled in EMBA programs according to the Executive MBA Council, and 75 percent of those students paid for all or part of their expenses. To give you an idea of what this decision could mean for you, first, we have to discuss the case.
The Kopaigora Case 
It all started when Alex Kopaigora, a 42-year-old executive MBA student at Brigham Young University, decided to deduct $18,879 from his taxes for tuition and commuting. Unfortunately for Kopaigora, the IRS didn’t agree with his tax return. The IRS cited the fact that he was unemployed for several months of that year as a reason to come after him for thousands of dollars. But when the case was brought before a judge, the IRS lost and the Kopaigoras were able to save $2,111 on their taxes.
However, it wasn’t an easy win. Unlike many other taxpayers in Tax Court, Kopaigora was represented by a lawyer who provided the expert representation he needed. When speaking with the Wall Street Journal, Kopaigora said, “I knew the deductions were legitimate, but the IRS just disallowed them. Most people give up and write a check, but I had a little more grit.”
So, why is this decision in Tax Court so important? It changes a precedent.
Before the Kopaigora case, there were countless examples of tax court cases where the MBA student came out on the bottom. For example, Adam Hart, a Rollins College MBA, lost his $17,138 tax deduction in 2009 when the judge pointed out that Hart wasn’t required to get an MBA by his employer and that he was not consistently “carrying on a trade of business.”
While there’s no clear reason for Hart’s loss and Kopaigora’s win, it all comes down to tax law.
Tax Law
Tax law can be a complicated business with many intricacies. The current rules don’t allow education costs to be reimbursed as business expenses if the courses prepare the student for a new type of business or license, such as in the case of a law degree or nursing. In fact, tuition is only considered deductible for three reasons:
When it improves or enhances the skills necessary for your job or business
When an MBA is a requirement requested by your employer or for regulations
When the education is related to the trade of business you are “carrying on,” meaning you need years of previous experience and must plan to return to the same career.
For years, the law’s wording has meant that many taxpayers in undergraduate and graduate school can’t take deductions—although other tax benefits offset some costs. However, it has always been more complicated for MBA students. Since many MBAs have jobs before enrolling in their MBA program and are only seeking to “maintain or improve” their skills, and the MBA doesn’t lead to a license, many students qualify for a deduction. But up until this point, the IRS has challenged many MBA deductions and used fine distinctions to make their point. For example, the IRS has fought back against deductions from MBA students who decided to switch career fields after graduation.
Now, thanks to one judge’s decision to rule in favor of MBA students, MBA deductions could become a whole lot easier.
How Will the Results Affect MBA Tax Deductions
There are two main ways the ruling in the Kopaigora v. Commissions of Internal Revenue case will help MBA students.
First, Executive MBA students now have a precedent of justification for their education deductions.
Second, unemployed MBAs will be able to deduct their education as “unreimbursed business expenses.”
Both of these points are good news for taxpayers. Now, full-time MBA students will have an easier time counting their education as a deduction, and executive MBAs can point to another case where a deduction was allowed.
Still, the question remains for many MBA students: to claim or not to claim. According to Robert Willens, a tax expert at Columbia Business School, “This case is a big win for all MBA students. Now it’s harder for the IRS to say that being in a full-time program bars the deduction.”

Campus Times Pune,9/9/2016 16:15,"[vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Entrepreneurs have the ability to change the way we live our lives. Their successful innovations can improve our way of living and can aid in the development of society. They not only create wealth for the economy but also are reckoned as job-creators and beacons of prosperity.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Young people across India need to be helped to identify and develop entrepreneurial attitudes as well as to develop appropriate managerial competencies if they are to stand out in the world.
[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur is a student organization established with the aim of fostering the spirit of entrepreneurship among college students in India. They are one of the most successful entrepreneurial organisations in the country with over 50 start-ups incubated within 8 years of inception. They play a vital role in developing  the upcoming start-ups into successful companies by taking a great initiation of conducting their flagship competition Empresario, their Annual and India's only Global Business Model Competition.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]It has been observed that startups with static business plans fail miserably since reality does not conform to their assumptions. Hence, there is a need for a more dynamic methodology while starting up and this is why the Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur sought to undertake a Business Model competition, which was titled; Empresario. Empresario accepts business ideas in all fields which include Product and Service, Product Design and Social categories. Each of the entries get equal opportunity to win the prize and incubation money to the tune of INR 2.5 crore.. Previously, Empresario has been launched in association with TiE Kolkata, Mahindra Spark the Rise and Dell Social Innovation Challenge.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]Empresario is about recognizing that any new venture is just a guess at a problem / solution and the only way to test whether those guesses are correct is to “get outside the building” and validate their idea with customer feedback. A business model is designed to change rapidly to reflect what you find outside the building in talking to customers. It’s more visual, dynamic and it reflects the iterative reality that startups face.[/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width=""1/3""][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=""1/3""][ult_buttons btn_title=""Register Online!"" btn_link=""url:http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecell-iitkgp.org%2Fempresario%2Fsignup.php||target:%20_blank|"" btn_align=""ubtn-center"" btn_size=""ubtn-mini"" btn_title_color=""#ffffff"" btn_bg_color=""#ffcc33"" btn_hover=""ubtn-left-bg"" btn_title_color_hover=""#17ad49"" icon=""Defaults-forward"" icon_size=""18"" icon_color=""#17ad49"" btn_icon_pos=""ubtn-sep-icon-right-push"" btn_border_style=""solid"" btn_color_border=""#ffcc33"" btn_color_border_hover=""#17ad49"" btn_border_size=""2"" btn_radius=""1"" btn_shadow=""shd-bottom"" btn_shadow_color=""#fbb036"" btn_shadow_color_hover=""#14a053"" btn_shadow_size=""5"" btn_shadow_click=""enable"" btn_font_family=""font_family:Raleway|font_call:Raleway|variant:800"" btn_font_style=""font-weight:800;"" btn_font_size=""desktop:18px;""][/vc_column_inner][vc_column_inner width=""1/3""][/vc_column_inner][/vc_row_inner][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]This year, Entrepreneurship Cell IIT Kharagpur and IBM are proud to present Empresario 2016 in association with the prestigious International Business Model Competition (IBMC) which is co-hosted by Stanford, Harvard and Brigham University.
